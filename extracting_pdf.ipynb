This year’s Annual Performance Report (APR) highlights the progress we have made on our Strategic Plan and the Administration’s priorities, as well as areas where we are continuing to work to improve. In FY 2016, OPM delivered a range of diverse services for current, former, and aspiring Federal employees. We have strengthened our cybersecurity posture, worked with our interagency partners to strengthen and modernize our background investigation process, provided agency leaders and managers with Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data and tools that allow them to see the opinions of their workforce down to the office level and use this data to improve employee engagement, brought together managers and HR professionals to dispel myths about the Federal hiring process and clarify the flexibilities and tools they have to find and hire the best talent, expanded our Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to include Self Plus One and treatment coverage for families with autistic children, and have made strong progress to improve customer service to retirees. These are just a few of the many things we have accomplished. And, as this report highlights, we have focused on measurable results and used data to inform our decision-making. STRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY AND MODERNIZING IT SYSTEMS In FY 2016, the Office of the Chief Information Officer collaborated with the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and our interagency partners to strengthen our cybersecurity posture and modernize our IT systems, including enhancements to the security of our legacy systems and network perimeter. In FY 2016, OPM has: • fully implemented Phase 1 of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. We will continue implementation of Phase 2 and Phase 3 in coordination with DHS. CDM will allow us to communicate with DHS more rapidly and effectively during any potential cybersecurity incident. We exceeded our goal of covering 95 percent of our network with Phase 1 capabilities by the end of FY 2016; • completed the implementation of the latest release of Einstein, Release 3 Accelerated, which is a DHS IT defensive system that collects, detects, and prevents cyber-threats and potential cyber-attacks; • encrypted 63.6 percent of our high value asset databases, exceeding our FY 2016 target of 60 percent; • improved our documentation of our system compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act, exceeding our FY 2016 target; 6 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report• deployed two-factor strong authentication for all users, which provides a robust barrier to OPM’s networks from individuals who are not authorized to have access; • deployed HTTPS web security access protections for all OPM web pages; • established a new 24-hour Security Operations Center; • formalized and improved OPM’s cybersecurity incident response process; and • deployed new cybersecurity tools, including software that helps to prevent malicious programs and viruses on OPM’s networks. While OPM was one of the leaders in all categories in FY 2015 for the Cybersecurity Cross-Agency Priority Goal, and is becoming a recognizable leader among Federal agencies in meeting or exceeding IT security milestones, there is work to be done. We will continue to modernize our systems and monitor our progress towards meeting our targets in this and other key measures in FY 2017. IMPROVING FEDERAL BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS In January 2016, the Federal Government announced a series of changes to modernize and further secure the way it conducts investigations for Federal employees and contractors. Central to this announcement was the establishment of the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), a new entity with a strong national security focus, dedicated solely to the background investigations process. While the NBIB is part of OPM, the Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for the design, development, and security of its IT systems. Although the NBIB was formally established on October 1, 2016, an interagency transition team spent much of FY 2016 preparing for NBIB to start functioning. This team made significant progress toward establishing rubrics for NBIB that will fundamentally strengthen this critical function. The NBIB will have modernized business processes and tools, a new organizational model to bolster privacy and intergovernmental communications, and an updated governance structure that will better align policy and operations and facilitate continuous improvements. As part of this transition, OPM was hard at work building capacity. In FY 2016, OPM made 400 conditional offers of employment to Federal field investigators, brought 363 onboard during the fiscal year, and brought the remaining 37 onboard by the end of CY 2016. OPM also awarded fieldwork contracts to two additional investigative fieldwork service providers–increasing the number of fieldwork contractors from two to four. Although we did not meet our background investigation timeliness targets in FY 2016, this increase in capacity will help us to improve moving forward. SUPPORTING AN ENGAGED, INNOVATIVE, DIVERSE, AND PRODUCTIVE FEDERAL WORKFORCE During FY 2016, OPM led efforts to provide leaders and managers at every level of the Federal Government with tools to make data-driven decisions (to the extent compatible with applicable law) to enhance employee engagement. Since 2009, OPM has conducted the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) on an annual basis and developed dynamic tools such as UnlockTalent.gov and the Employee Viewpoint Survey Online Reporting & Analysis Tool to provide leaders and managers with actionable information to improve employee engagement. In that time period, the number of reports to managers and supervisors increased from fewer than 1,000 to more than 26,000. Our data shows that more leaders and managers are accessing these tools. In FY 2016, more than 83 percent of Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) Act agency component-level reports were accessed –an increase from nearly 73 percent in FY 2015. In addition, 67 percent of lower-level component reports were accessed–an increase from 45 percent in FY 2015. 7 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report This year’s FEVS results show the progress we have made to drive greater employee engagement across the Federal workforce. For the second year in a row, the Government-wide employee engagement and global satisfaction indices have risen by one percentage point, breaking a four-year decline. Additionally, 68 percent of the major components or bureaus in agencies increased their employee engagement scores by at least 1 percentage point and 21 percent increased by 6 percentage points or more. More than 70 percent of CHCO organizations increased their “leaders lead” score (which reflects how employees perceive the character and competency of their leaders), exceeding our FY 2016 target of 50 percent. OPM continued efforts to help agencies create inclusive work environments and a diverse Federal workforce. In FY 2016, OPM announced that the Federal Government surpassed the goal of 100,000 new hires of individuals with disabilities set by a 2010 Executive Order. We continued to see significant progress in expanding opportunities for veterans in many agencies. In FY 2015, the Veteran's Employment Initiative expanded its focus on veteran new hires, disabled veteran new hires, veterans onboard, and veteran retention rates. Since a FY 2009 Executive Order, 24 different agencies have hired more than half a million veterans. In addition, we have worked hard to help mentor, encourage, and facilitate the ability of women to move up the leadership ladder. In September 2009, 30.6 percent of the SES was composed of women. As of March 2016, that percentage was 35. In addition, we have essentially erased any pay gap between men and women at the SES level. OPM developed new tools to help agencies promote inclusion in the workplace, and administered training concerning the concept of unconscious bias to more than 2,000 Federal employees. OPM has provided “New IQ” technical assistance training to more than 10,000 Federal managers and employees since FY 2013. New IQ is a measure of employee satisfaction based on 20 questions from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey that focus on key areas of inclusion such as equitable treatment of employees and support of diversity. In FY 2016, the Government-wide New IQ score increased from 57 to 58 percent. OPM also launched a nationwide “Hiring Excellence Campaign”–a series of 32 guidance sessions around the country and in virtual forums with participants from 45 agencies. The 8 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Reportcampaign brought together Federal HR specialists and hiring managers to help agencies better understand and use existing hiring flexibilities and processes to find and hire the best talent. More than 3,000 supervisors and human resource professionals attended these forums. Ninety-two percent of participants rated the workshops positively and approximately three months after attending a workshop, 74 percent of participants reported that they applied what they learned to their job. We worked aggressively to implement a 2015 Executive Order on Strengthening the Senior Executive Service to support efforts to hire the best talent, strengthen development, and improve accountability for the senior executives across the Federal Government. Agencies have developed plans to streamline their SES hiring processes. GSA and the Department of Energy successfully piloted resume-only applications for career executive positions, significantly cutting their overall time to hire. The Department of Energy shaved 90 days from their hiring timeline. In support of the Cybersecurity National Action Plan and in collaboration with interagency partners, OPM released a Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy to help meet the growing need for talented cybersecurity professionals in the Federal Government. The plan addresses how to recruit, develop, and retain new and existing talent, and builds off a vision where cybersecurity professionals see a tour of duty in Federal service as an essential stop in their career trajectory. The plan will not only develop a modern cybersecurity workforce but may also serve as a blueprint to inform hiring needs for other critical occupations in the future. In July, OPM helped DHS fill several hundred critical cybersecurity positions by enabling it to use an expedited hiring process at a job fair that drew thousands of candidates. DHS interviewed more than 800 candidates at that job fair and made offers to more than 400 computer scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs–with many of these candidates already having joined the Government.PROVIDING TOP QUALITY HEALTH BENEFITS OPM is proud that the excellent and affordably priced employee health benefits long supplied through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) are a key incentive for many Federal employees to join or stay in Federal service. In FY 2016, OPM has taken steps to continue to improve its insurance offerings, improve the quality of care delivered, and expand access to health care through value based payment and benefit updates. Pursuant to a more recent statutory authority, OPM also extended insurance benefits through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to employees of certain tribes, tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations. The FEHB T ribal Program became available in May 2012 with an initial 15 tribal employers, and has grown to more than 90 such employers today. In FY 2016, more than 19,000 tribal employees received health care coverage, exceeding our target of 18,000. OPM’s FEHB T ribal Desk built the program’s infrastructure, including the enrollment and premium collection system, created marketing and information materials, provided outreach to T ribal employers, and delivered training programs for T ribal Benefits Officers. As a result, members of the T ribal Desk were recipients of a 2016 President’s Customer Service Award. OPM continued to strengthen the FEHBP by offering comprehensive benefits with strong consumer protections. In 2016, OPM began to offer Self Plus One, a new enrollment type that covers the enrollee and one designated eligible family member. As of March 2016, there were 542,297 Self Plus One enrollments. OPM launched its updated Plan Comparison Tool during Open Season 2016, and allowed employees to shop for coverage more easily, sorting plans by key attributes such as premium, deductible, and maximum out-of-pocket cost. Additionally, 2016 was the first year that FEHB carrier profit was linked to plan performance on 19 measures of clinical quality, customer service, and resource use. Further, in FY 2016, OPM announced that 9 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report starting in calendar year 2017, all FEHB insurers will be required to cover applied behavior analysis treatment for childhood autism. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded the scope of OPM’s mission to include contracting with health insurance issuers to offer health insurance plans to uninsured individuals and their families, and employees of small businesses through the creation of the Multi-State Plan program. In 2016, consumers in 33 states and the District of Columbia had a Multi-State Plan option as part of their health coverage choices, and 420,000 people have selected this coverage in the marketplace. IMPROVING RETIREMENT CUSTOMER SERVICE OPM is responsible for the administration of the Federal Retirement Program covering more than 2.7 million active employees, including the United States Postal Service, and nearly 2.6 million annuitants and survivors. OPM is dedicated to processing Federal retirement claims quickly and accurately to comply with Congress’s direction and provide the best possible support to annuitants. During FY 2016, OPM processed more than 77 percent of the retirement cases within 60 days or less. Although the agency did not meet its target of processing 90 percent of retirement cases within 60 days or less, it has made considerable strides in processing claims over time. In 2012, the average processing time for all cases completed was 173 days. By 2016, the processing time had been reduced to an average of 54 days. Since January 2012, OPM reduced the claims inventory from 61,108 cases to 15,146 at the end of FY 2016. While part of the retirement process is paper- based, in FY 2016, OPM remained focused on transitioning to a fully-digitized process. We are continuing to develop high-level functional requirements for a case management system and an online retirement application. Further, we focused on improving customer service in our Retirement Services call center. In FY 2016, OPM handled nearly 1.1 million retirement program customer calls, or 66.8 percent of all calls received by the call center. Although we did not meet our target of handling at least 78 percent of all customer calls, we took steps to improve. To help reduce wait times and assist more retirees and their families, we consolidated all of the call center activities into one location to improve oversight, provided better coaching and mentoring for staff, and hired 38 new representatives. In addition, we have upgraded and added features to the web-based self-service retirement services online website servicesonline.opm.gov . Retirees can use the website to update their mailing addresses, change their Federal and state income tax withholding designations, request a duplicate annuity booklet, or print their Retirement Services ID card. The more retirees and their families turn to our online services for basic needs, the quicker our team can respond to more complex questions. LEADING THE HUMAN CAPITAL CATEGORY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE OPM led the Government-wide Human Capital Category Management initiative to help the Federal Government simplify and streamline the procurement of human capital-related services. In FY 2016, OPM established the Category Management Leadership Council, hired the human capital category manager for the Federal Government, and developed the first human capital category management strategic plan. BUILDING CAPACITY FOR EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY As part of its goal to become a thought leader in research and data-driven human resource management and policy decision-making, OPM held its inaugural Research Summit in partnership with American University. The Research Summit brought together over 150 academic researchers, 20 Federal agencies, and 20 universities to discuss research in six human capital areas: work/life issues, benefits, performance management, diversity and inclusion, leadership, and employee engagement. In addition, OPM hosted the first 10 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Reportever Human Capital Analytics Symposium, where we shared strategies on how we can use data to inform decision-making in everything from hiring to recruitment to performance management, consistent with applicable law. COMPLETENESS AND RELIABILITY OF PERFORMANCE INFORMATION The performance information used by OPM in this report is complete and reliable, as defined by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010. If there are instances where full and complete data for a measure is not available, those instances are noted, and final data will be provided in the FY 2017 APR.CONCLUSION It has been an honor to lead an agency where 96.3 percent of employees indicated that they would be willing to put in the extra effort to get the job done. Together, through dedication, communication, collaboration, and a focus on customer service, we have made some real progress toward achieving our mission. As we continue to focus on measurable results and use data to inform our decision-making, we will continue to deliver and serve our customer agencies and the American people with excellence, and realize our vision of making the Federal Government a model employer for the 21 st century. Kathleen McGettiganActing DirectorMay 22, 2017 11 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report OPM OVERVIEW As the Federal Government’s chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager, OPM aspires to Recruit, Retain and Honor a World-Class Workforce to Serve the American People by directing human resources policy; promoting best practice in human resource management; administering retirement, healthcare, and insurance programs; overseeing merit-based and inclusive hiring practices within the civil service; and providing a secure employment process. HISTORY OPM’s history began on January 16, 1883. On this date, President Chester A. Arthur signed the Civil Service Act of 1883. Among other things, the Act established OPM’s predecessor agency, the United States Civil Service Commission. Prior to 1883, Federal employment was largely based on political affiliation or personal connections, a system known as the “spoils system,” rather than candidates’ knowledge, skills, and abilities. The newly established merit system ushered in a new era and created a competitive civil service, which emphasized an applicant’s relative qualifications for the position being sought, after fair and open competition. Future President Theodore Roosevelt served as Civil Service Commissioner from 1889-95. His energetic and reform-minded outlook made him a strong proponent of the merit system as both Commissioner and later as U.S. President. Another watershed date in OPM’s history occurred in 1978. With the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Civil Service Commission was abolished and reorganized into four new organizations: the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, including an office within the Board that would later become a fifth separate agency, the Office of Special Counsel; the Federal Labor Relations Authority; and the Office of Government Ethics. Each of these new organizations took over a portion of the Civil Service Commission’s responsibilities, with OPM responsible, among other things, for personnel management of the civil service of the Government. PROFILE Ranked as one of the best places to work in the Federal Government, OPM maintains its headquarters in the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Office Building at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, D.C. OPM has field offices in 16 locations across the country, and operating centers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia. OPM’s FY 2016 gross budget, including appropriated, mandatory administrative authorities and revolving fund activities, totaled $2,112,694,424. In FY 2016, the agency had 5,079 full-time equivalent employees. OPM’s discretionary budget authority, excluding the Office of the Inspector General, was $245,238,000. For more information about OPM, please refer to the agency’s website, opm .gov. 12 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportPURPOSE AND SCOPE The FY 2016 APR provides an overview of OPM’s progress in implementing the strategies and achieving the goals in its FY 2014-FY 2018 Strategic Plan. The APR is issued concurrent with OPM’s FY 2018 Congressional Budget Justification, and is intended to be used by Congress in reviewing the agency’s budget proposals. It is also intended to help Congress, the President, and the public assess OPM’s stewardship over the financial resources entrusted to the agency in FY 2016. The FY 2016 APR meets reporting requirements in the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, which focuses on improving performance and accountability among Federal agencies, and guidance described in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11. The report does not include performance information for additional Government-wide mandated or compliance functions supported by OPM or enabling structural capacity functions of OPM. These functions, which include executive direction and leadership, legal advice and representation, public affairs, and administrative operations, support the accomplishment of OPM’s goals, but are not included in the strategic plan. The strategies in OPM’s Strategic Plan are the primary units of analysis in this report. As part of its annual performance budgeting process, the agency develops performance measures and targets aligned to these strategies. The targets indicate the agency’s planned levels of performance, and were set based on the amount of resources requested for each strategy. In this report, the agency compares these planned levels of performance to actual performance, explaining any variances or trends. OPM identifies successful or promising practices relative to the performance targets, and where targets were not met, describes plans for improvement. Under separate cover, OPM publishes an Agency Financial Repor t, focusing on financial results. All reports are available on the OPM website at https://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/performance/ . 13 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report RESULTS OPM : OPM’S PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH Develop 4-year Strategic PlanSet 2-year Agency Priority Goals Aligned to Plan Develop Annual Performance Budget Aligned to PlanSelect Performance Measures and Set Targets to Gauge Progress Collect ResultsAnalyze and Verify ResultsReport ResultsReview Results, including in Quarterly Performance Point MeetingsPlan/Strategize Make Changes to Improve Performance OPM is committed to building a strong performance culture through effective performance management processes that are designed to promote management decision-making based on the use of data to measure progress toward specific goals. OPM’s performance management cycle, dubbed Results OPM, consists of (1) planning; (2) prioritization; (3) selecting measures and setting targets; (4) collecting results; (5) analyzing and verifying results; (6) reporting results; (7) reviewing results; and (8) using the results to make changes to improve performance. 14 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report1. Planning: Every four years, OPM develops a strategic plan, which presents the agency’s long-term strategic goals. As part of the annual budgeting process, OPM develops performance plans that reflect the full scope of the strategic plan and describe the level of performance to be achieved in the current and next fiscal year. 2. Prioritization: Based on the top priorities of the agency and Administration, OPM develops two-year Agency Priority Goals (APG) and action plans that are aligned to the strategic plan. The Agency Priority Goals are near-term priorities and results that the agency wants to accomplish. 3. Selecting measures and setting targets: The agency develops performance measures and sets targets to gauge its progress in implementing its strategic plan and Agency Priority Goal action plans. 4. Collecting results: OPM measures its performance and collects results at the agency-wide level every four to eight weeks. 5. Analyzing and verifying results: OPM analyzes its performance results, exploring the data and conducting “deep dive” analyses as needed. The agency verifies the results to promote accuracy and reliability. 6. Reporting results: OPM reports performance information every four to eight weeks via dashboard reports for internal decision-makers, quarterly via Agency Priority Goal updates for Performance.gov , and annually via the Annual Performance Report. 7. Reviewing results: OPM conducts data-driven performance meetings every four to eight weeks, including quarterly Performance Point meetings chaired by the Director, to review key data and to bring together the people, resources, and analysis needed to drive progress. Agency leaders diagnose problems and opportunities, learn from past experience, and decide next steps to improve performance. 8. Using the results to make changes to improve performance: To improve performance, OPM tracks and follows-up on action items that resulted from its performance review meetings. The agency also uses performance results to inform future plans, including budgets. Where the results indicate a need to transform processes, OPM uses agency experts in Lean Six Sigma, Human Centered Design, and other process improvement methodologies to identify root causes and develop solutions. 15 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report OPM’S STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK In its pursuit of the nine strategic goals outlined in the agency’s Strategic Plan for FY 2014-FY 2018, OPM aims to achieve its mission: Recruit, Retain and Honor a World-Class Workforce to Serve the American People. The agency divides its strategic goals into two categories: management and program outcome goals. Management goals are focused on OPM’s internal systems and processes, while the program outcome goals are focused on OPM’s external responsibilities. Each goal is supported by implementation strategies, and the agency monitors the performance results aligned to each strategy to track its progress towards achieving the goals in the Strategic Plan. OPM’s Strategic Plan is available at https://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/strategic-plans/2014-2018-strategic-plan.pdf . Performance and accountability at OPM begins with this plan.

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL • Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts comprehensive and independent audits, investigations, and evaluations relating to OPM programs and operations. It is responsible for administrative actions against health care providers that commit sanctionable offenses with respect to the FEHBP or other OPM programs. The OIG keeps the Director and Congress fully informed about problems and deficiencies in the administration of agency programs and operations, and the need for corrective action. 22 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportMAJOR MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES AND CHALLENGES Major management challenges are management and programmatic issues and risks or areas that have greater vulnerability to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement where failure to perform could seriously affect the agency’s mission delivery and ability to achieve its goals. OPM’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified several management challenges and divided them into environmental challenges and internal challenges. Environmental challenges result mainly from factors external to OPM and may be long-term or even permanent. Internal challenges are likely short-term, temporary challenges. This section describes the actions OPM took in FY 2016 to address the following 10 challenges identified by the OIG in FY 2015, and an eleventh challenge identified in FY 2016. Environmental challenges : 1. Strategic human capital 2. Federal health insurance initiatives Internal challenges : 3. Information security governance 4. Security assessment and authorization 5. Data security 6. Information technology infrastructure improvement project7. Stopping the flow of improper payments 8. Retirement claims processing 9. Procurement process for benefit programs 10. Procurement process oversight In FY 2016, the OIG added the following environmental challenge: 11. Background investigations 23 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report 1. STRATEGIC HUMAN CAPITAL Closing Skills Gaps Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy 8.03: Provide guidance, tools, and training to help agencies attain human capital management goals and meet OPM requirements • Agency Priority Goal: HR Workforce Capability Responsible Agency Officials • Veronica Villalobos, Principle Deputy Associate Director, Employee Services • Shanaz Porter, Manager, Forecasting and Methods, Strategic Workforce Planning • Linda Datcher, Manager, Learning and Development, Strategic Workforce Planning • Mark Reinhold, Associate Director, Employee Services Strategic human capital management, specifically as it relates to closing skill gaps in Government-wide mission critical occupations, remains on the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) high-risk list of Government-wide challenges requiring focused attention. FY 2016 Progress Update Throughout FY 2016, OPM continued to lead and support the Chief Human Capital Officers Council’s formal executive steering committee in identifying and closing skills gaps in Government-wide and agency-specific mission critical occupations. In FY 2016, high-risk Government-wide mission critical occupations included economist, HR specialist, auditor, acquisition, cybersecurity, and the STEM functional area. Upon identifying the Government-wide and agency-specific mission critical occupations, OPM and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council identified and established Federal action skill teams responsible for leading the effort to: (1) identify root causes of skill gaps in the occupations; (2) develop strategies to address prioritized root causes; (3) establish goals and outcome-oriented metrics; (4) document action plans to address skill gaps; and (5) submit quarterly updates to OPM to monitor progress on executing action plans and achieving targets. The Government-wide Federal action skill teams were led by occupational leaders who are respected senior technical subject matter experts in Government-wide mission critical occupations. The occupational leaders were partnered with a Chief Human Capital Officer who provided human resource policy and strategy guidance. In March and April 2016, OPM conducted four in-person training sessions and one virtual training session for Federal action skill teams on topics such as how to apply root cause analysis and develop action plans and metrics. Throughout the process, OPM, in coordination with the executive steering committee, provided ongoing support and technical guidance to agencies and occupational leaders. Concurrently, OPM, in coordination with OMB, published the proposed rule for revising Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 250. The regulation, among other things, addresses skill gaps and requires agencies to (1) make progress toward closing any knowledge, skill, and competency gaps; (2) use the OPM designated method to identify skill gaps; (3) monitor and address skill gaps within Government-wide and agency mission critical occupations; (4) describe the skills and human capital information required to achieve agency goals and objectives according to agency strategic plans; and (5) include explicit descriptions of agency skill and competency gaps that must be closed according to annual human capital operating plans. OPM has had success in creating an infrastructure and governance structures for closing HR skills gaps across the Federal Government. The agency has built coalitions with professionals across the Federal Government to participate and collaborate on activities that will assist agencies in developing strategies over the scope of the five-year strategic plan for closing HR skills gaps. 24 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportPhased Retirement The OIG identified phased retirement as a management challenge in FY 2015, but removed it in FY 2016. OPM fulfilled its primary role of providing regulations and comprehensive guidance to Federal agencies, and is unaware of any significant roadblocks that would prevent an agency from implementing phased retirement. Agencies are continuing to develop phased retirement plans/policies, complete bargaining obligations, and initiate pilot programs for their employees. OPM continues to provide assistance to agencies on phased retirement as necessary. 2. FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE INITIATIVES Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) Program-wide Claims Analysis/Health Claims Data Warehouse Related Strategies and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 9.01 Sponsor high quality, affordable insurance products • Strategy: 9.02 Optimize insurance-related business processes • Agency Priority Goal: FEHB Plan Performance Responsible Agency Officials • Anne Easton, Deputy Director, Planning and Policy Analysis • Alan Spielman, Director, Healthcare and Insurance OPM is responsible for ensuring that Federal Employees Health Benefits Program participants receive quality health care services while controlling the costs of premium increases. This has been a challenge because, historically, OPM had not routinely collected or analyzed program-wide claims data. In response to this challenge, OPM initiated the Health Claims Data Warehouse project in order to collect, maintain, and analyze health care data on an ongoing basis.FY 2016 Progress Update OPM completed the development of the Health Claims Data Warehouse system. OPM’s primary challenges are (1) to ensure that the claims data is entered into the system in a way that facilitates data analysis and manipulation, and (2) to ensure that the data is secure. OPM implemented high security features such as data encryption, masking, and redaction, to protect carrier data. The system was granted an Authority to Operate by the Chief Information Security Office. Additionally, the OIG reviewed the security systems in place for the warehouse and determined that they met the necessary criteria to protect sensitive data. In May 2016, OPM began populating the health claims data warehouse with data from experience-rated carriers. By the close of FY 2017, OPM expects to have populated the system with data from experience-rated and community-rated carriers, and completed initial analyses of selected high volume episodes of care. Prescription Drug Benefits and Costs OPM provides oversight of prescription drug costs administered by health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. Prescription drug costs represent approximately 25 percent of total FEHB Program costs. Therefore, OPM promotes the principle that health plans should offer their best arrangements for prescription drugs. Many carriers use pharmacy benefit managers to administer their prescription drug coverage. In order to offer a prescription drug benefit that is competitive and cost effective, OPM hired a new Chief Pharmacy Officer with extensive formulary management experience. FY 2016 Progress Update The agency has called on participating health plans to: • better manage pharmacy networks; • implement, operate, and reinforce drug utilization management strategies; • coordinate coverage of specialty drugs between the medical and pharmacy benefit; 25 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report • utilize formulary design principles to optimize the prescription drug benefit; and • implement cost comparison tools that give current and prospective enrollees access to user-friendly information about the formulary tier and member cost-share for prescription drugs. Self-reported data from carriers demonstrates efforts to keep the prescription drug benefit competitive and cost effective. Almost all of the top 20 plans with the largest FEHB enrollment utilized cost share tiers. The specific tiers varied, with Generic Drugs, Preferred Brand Name, and Non-preferred Brand Name tiers being the most common. Of the top 20 plans’ networks, 15 were characterized as broad, four as managed, and one as tiered. Plans continued to employ utilization management strategies, with the biggest change in increased implementation of coordination of benefits for Medicare Part B. In 2014, plans covering 28 percent of members had coordination of benefits, increasing to 92 percent of members in 2015. All of the top 20 plans, and 90 percent of all plans, utilize retrospective drug utilization review. Medication therapy management is used by 75 percent of the top 20 plans and 70 percent of all plans, a slight increase from 67 percent of all plans in 2014. Use of narrow networks remains unchanged from 2014 for the top 20 plans at 20 percent, and has increased slightly for all plans from 28 percent to 30 percent. Depending on the drug, plans employ strategies such as quantity limits, step therapy, and prior approval. For example, 16 of the top 20 plans use quantity limits as a narcotic management strategy. Step therapy is used for nine of the top 20 plans for sleep medications. A prior approval requirement is applied to many high-cost specialty drugs, such as Humira. Humira (a common injectable treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis) requires prior approval in 17 of the top 20 plans. Of the top 20 plans, all offer a drug cost calculator with at least the ability to search for individual drugs. Seventeen plans utilize an interactive tool. Member uptake varies by plan, from zero percent to 56 percent of members utilizing the cost tool.In presentation forums and written communication with carriers, OPM emphasized the safe and effective use of pain medications, the availability of Medication-Assisted Therapy for individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder, and enhancing access to narcotic reversal agents. Health Benefit Carriers’ Fraud and Abuse Programs Carriers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program are required to operate fraud, waste, and abuse programs designed to prevent, detect, investigate, report, and eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse by employees, subcontractors, health care providers, and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program members. The fraud, waste, and abuse programs must follow industry standards and adhere to mandatory information sharing requirements via written case notifications and referrals to OIG. FY 2016 Progress Update In response to recent OIG audits and annual carrier reporting, OPM further examined its practices and procedures and has made several changes to strengthen its existing fraud, waste, and abuse monitoring and enforcement. In FY 2016, OPM: • strengthened its productive relationship with the OIG in addressing open fraud-related audit recommendations; • presented an overview of the fraud, waste, and abuse program requirements and discussed updated guidance on fraud, waste, and abuse reporting to the FEHB Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Task Force meeting in January 2016; • worked with the auditors, Audit Resolution, and Program Analysis and Systems Support groups to conduct more comprehensive training for Health Insurance Specialists (contracts specialists) on updated fraud, waste, and abuse requirements; and • coordinated with internal stakeholders to review, analyze, and respond to questions from the annual reports received from the plans and the challenges plans face in meeting reporting requirements. 26 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportMedical Loss Ratio Implementation and Oversight OPM’s Office of the Actuaries closely monitors the Federal Employees Health Benefits medical loss ratio methodology and documents each year’s ratio for each community-rated plan, and the associated penalties or credits, in a formal letter. The Office of the Actuaries works closely with OPM’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer to confirm that proper accounting for medical loss ratio credits and penalties is established to ensure that both disbursement and receipts of medical loss ratio transactions are appropriately accounted for and documented. In order to calculate the medical loss ratio, carriers divide the total portion of premium dollars spent on clinical services and quality improvement by the total premium income received. Community-rated carriers are required to spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on medical care, and may use the remaining portion of premium dollars on other costs such as administration, overhead, and marketing. OPM provides carriers with their subscription income to use in the Medical Loss Ratio calculation. However, because of OPM’s decentralized enrollment and payroll systems, these amounts may differ from the premium income amounts carriers have tracked in their own internal systems. Carriers may choose to use their own premium amounts when calculating the medical loss ratio, but these amounts are subject to audit. FY 2016 Progress Update OPM agrees that the subscription income report is not perfect. However, given the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program decentralized enrollment and payroll systems, the payment collection and disbursement method to carriers is not able to yield a completely precise result, which is why the agency allows carriers to use their own income calculation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program medical loss ratio calculation. Affordable Care Act Securing sufficient resources to further implement the Multi-State Plan Program, as well as attracting new issuers to the program, continue to be a challenge. The statute does not give OPM authority to compel any issuer to participate in the Multi-State Plan Program and explicitly prohibits OPM from requiring Federal Employees Health Benefits Program carriers to participate. Nor does the statute authorize the preemption of state law requirements governing health insurance. This lack of preemption capability is a significant difference between the Multi-State Plan Program and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These statutory challenges have been amplified by the volatility of the individual and small group health insurance markets, which has caused a number of issuers to cease offering products on the health insurance marketplaces (health insurance exchanges). FY 2016 Progress Update To meet the goal of making Multi-State Plan Program options available for enrollment in as many states as possible, OPM has accomplished the following: • contracted with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and two Co-Ops to offer Multi-State Plan options in 32 states plus the District of Columbia in 2016; • continued to develop relationships with state health care regulators to facilitate the exchange of information on Multi-State Plan Program operations and the state-specific requirements governing the sale of health insurance in a state; • held a Multi-State Plan issuer conference in November 2015; • conducted outreach efforts to insurance issuers and other groups to raise awareness of the Multi-State Plan Program in order to expand the Program to additional states; • continued to work with the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health and Human Services to develop standard operating procedures for collecting the Multi-State Plan user fee; • compiled and transmitted information on each applicable state-level issuer to (1) the 27 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Department of Health and Human Services for the Federally Facilitated Marketplace, (2) states that intend to operate their own exchange but utilize the prescribed Department of Health and Human Services templates, and (3) states that operate their own marketplace; and • held a second meeting of the Multi-State Plan Program Advisory Board, established in FY 2015, to exchange information, ideas, and recommendations regarding the administration of the Multi-State Plan Program. 3. INFORMATION SECURITY GOVERNANCE Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 4.03 Implement enterprise initiatives that leverage capabilities and tools throughout OPM • Agency Priority Goal: Cybersecurity Monitoring Responsible Agency Official • Cord Chase, Chief Information Security Officer Information security governance is primarily focused on identifying key roles and responsibilities and managing information security policy development, oversight, and ongoing monitoring activities. Throughout FY 2015, OPM successfully filled the vacant information system security officer positions, effectively centralizing IT security responsibility under the Chief Information Officer. However, the OIG’s FY 2015 FISMA audit stated that system owners were still not in compliance with many FISMA requirements. FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM hired additional information system security officers to support the system owners with their FISMA compliance responsibilities. OPM continued to work closely with our oversight entities to address and close FISMA audit findings and remediate identified weaknesses. OPM established a Plan of Actions and Milestones Management Review Board that will provide consistent management decisions on the creation, review, update, closure, and cancellation of Plans of Actions and Milestones. Since 2007, OPM had 218 FISMA audit findings. As of the end of FY 2016, OPM had mitigated 165 out of the 218 findings (75.7 percent). In addition, OPM updated performance standards for IT Project Managers within the Office of the Chief Information Officer to include elements for complying with FISMA requirements, such as maintaining valid Authorities to Operate (ATOs) for information systems and remediating Plans of Actions and Milestones. 4. SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 4.03 Implement enterprise initiatives that leverage capabilities and tools throughout OPM • Agency Priority Goal: Cybersecurity Monitoring Responsible Agency Official • Cord Chase, Chief Information Security Officer Information System Security Assessment and Authorization (Authorization) is a comprehensive assessment that evaluates whether a system’s security controls are meeting the security requirements of that system. In FY 2015, the OIG found that the number of OPM systems without a current and valid authorization increased, and the OIG reinstated its previous material weakness related to this issue in its FY 2015 FISMA audit. FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM increased the resources available to support the Authority to Operate process. OPM hired additional information system security officers to support the system owners and awarded an Authority to Operate support contract to help standardize the authorization process. At the end of FY 2016, 67.4 percent of OPM IT systems had current authorities to operate. 28 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report5. DATA SECURITY Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 4.03 Implement enterprise initiatives that leverage capabilities and tools throughout OPM • Agency Priority Goal: Cybersecurity Monitoring Responsible Agency Official • David DeVries, Chief Information Officer The OIG audit found that OPM’s technical environment was complex and decentralized, and stated that these characteristics made it extremely difficult to secure. Over the past several years, the OIG credited OPM with increasing the staffing levels of its network security team, and procuring a variety of tools to help automate efforts to secure the OPM network. However, the OIG’s FY 2015 Federal Information Security Management Act audit determined that not all of these tools were being utilized to their fullest capacity, and found that OPM was having difficulty implementing and enforcing the new controls on all endpoints of its decentralized infrastructure. FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM encrypted 63.6 percent of its high value databases, exceeding its target of 60 percent, and completed deployment of two-factor strong authentication for all users, which provides a strong barrier to OPM’s networks from individuals who are not authorized to have access. OPM was one of the first agencies to fully implement Phase 1 of the DHS’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. In FY 2016, OPM exceeded its target to cover 95 percent of its network by Phase 1 of the CDM program, which identifies cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis and prioritizes these risks based on the potential severity of the risk. Phase 1 included installing security tools in the areas of hardware asset management, software asset management, vulnerability management, and configuration settings management. The agency is currently preparing for Phase 2, which will begin in FY 2017. Phase 2 capabilities include access control management, security-related behavior management, credentials and authentication management, and privileges. OPM will continue implementation of Phase 2 in coordination with DHS. CDM will also allow OPM to communicate with DHS more rapidly and effectively during any potential cybersecurity incident. 6. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 4.03 Implement enterprise initiatives that leverage capabilities and tools throughout OPM • Agency Priority Goal: Cybersecurity Monitoring Responsible Agency Official • David DeVries, Chief Information Officer OPM determined that its network infrastructure needed to be overhauled and migrated into a more centralized and manageable architecture. The OIG identified three challenges to OPM’s IT infrastructure improvement project: (1) OPM’s lack of a mature program to maintain a comprehensive, current, and accurate information system inventory; (2) the complexity of migrating old information systems (legacy technology) into a new environment; and (3) OPM’s lack of dedicated funding to support the project. FY 2016 Progress Update OPM has implemented an application inventory management tool to track and manage all software applications within OPM. The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program includes additional tools to monitor software deployed on the network and supplement the application inventory. In addition, OPM has also consolidated its hardware asset inventory into another application. In FY 2016, Federal IT Business Solutions, a division within the Office of the Chief Information Officer, completed a technology and platform upgrade of Employee Express. Additionally, OPM 29 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report continues to work on the modernization of OPM’s retirement systems using a digital services team. OPM has also begun to identify the baseline for owned applications and create application profiles, and start the development of Analysis of Alternatives. OPM reinstituted its Investment Review Board to provide a more corporate review of IT investments. In addition, in August 2016, the OPM Investment Review Board approved the Infrastructure as a Service Analysis of Alternatives, which recommended that OPM consolidate the nine data centers that it currently operates to two strategic locations in Macon, GA and Boyers, PA. The Analysis of Alternatives was developed as part of OPM’s effort to comply with the Office of Management and Budget’s Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative and OIG’s recommendation that OPM conduct an Analysis of Alternatives to determine the best future-state model for OPM’s IT infrastructure. OPM has started the data center consolidation effort, and has completed the move out of one data center, and will vacate a second data center in Q1 of FY 2017. During this consolidation, OPM continues to plan and prepare for system migrations. 7 . STOPPING THE FLOW OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 7.03 Advance the 21st century customer- focused retirement processing system for claims adjudication in a timely and accurate manner • Agency Priority Goal: Retirement Services Case Processing Responsible Agency Official • Kenneth Zawodny, Jr., Associate Director, Retirement Services Reducing improper payments by Federal agencies continues to be a top priority of both the Administration and Congress. OPM paid $82 billion in defined-benefits to retirees, survivors, representative payees, and families during FY 2016. OPM’s retirement programs continue to meet OMB’s definition of programs susceptible to significant improper payments because annual improper payments are more than $100 million per year. OPM’s recapture rate for improper payments has improved from 67.2 percent in FY 2013 to 78 percent in FY 2016, and the agency recovered funds amounting to $106.6 million. FY 2016 Progress Update The improper payments rate for the Retirement Program was .37 percent, well below the 1.5 percent threshold prescribed by statute. OPM’s rate represents the entirety of improper payments. The percentage to deceased annuitants is only roughly one third of that total. OPM developed and issued a comprehensive improper payments plan in 2012. OPM completed a revision of the plan in July 2015, and will update the plan in the second quarter of FY 2017 and each year thereafter. OPM has initiated an ongoing, concerted effort to review and correct social security numbers across the annuity roll so that both OPM’s records and those of the Social Security Administration contained in its death master file will have accurate and complete information. During FY 2016, the Retirement Inspections Branch continued to identify and document overpayment and cost savings through the Disability Earnings Match by terminating annuity payments to annuitants based on earned income information from the Social Security Administration. The Consolidated Death Match has identified and documented overpayments with receipt of death data from the Social Security Administration. OPM is working with the Social Security Administration to finalize a new Information Exchange Agreement that would authorize OPM to provide the Social Security Administration with recurring death information from OPM’s annuity roll. This would enable the Social Security Administration to better protect the integrity of its own Death Master File. OPM expects to complete the negotiations in the second quarter of FY 2017. 30 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportOPM continued work on renewing its agreement with the Office of Workers Compensation Program to conduct a match that would identify beneficiaries receiving both wage loss compensation for disability or death under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act, and retirement or death benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System for the same period. The concurrent receipt of both benefits is prohibited. 8. RETIREMENT CLAIMS PROCESSING Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 7.03 Advance the 21st century customer- focused retirement processing system for claims adjudication in a timely and accurate manner • Agency Priority Goal: Retirement Services Case Processing Responsible Agency Official • Kenneth Zawodny, Jr., Associate Director, Retirement Services OPM is responsible for the administration of the Federal Retirement Program covering more than 2.7 million active employees, including the United States Postal Service, and nearly 2.6 million annuitants and survivors. OPM is dedicated to processing Federal retirement claims quickly and accurately to provide the best possible support to annuitants. During FY 2016, OPM processed 77.1 percent of the retirement cases within 60 days or less. Those cases were processed in 45 days, on average. Cases requiring more than 60 days took 100 days, on average. FY 2016 Progress Update OPM continues to implement the core components in the Retirement Services Strategic Plan, which includes delivering quality customer service; implementing productivity and process improvements; partnering with agencies so that they are submitting complete and accurate retirement packages for quicker processing; and making progressive information technology improvements. OPM used Lean Six Sigma to streamline and standardize internal processes; for example, reviewing and assembling complete cases before distributing them to Legal Administrative Specialists for adjudication. OPM also partnered with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and United States Postal Service to help with claims processing, and coordinated biweekly meetings with United States Postal Service and the National Personnel Records Center to address common retirement processing issues. OPM is focused on transitioning the Retirement Program to a paperless system. To realize this vision, Retirement Services partnered with the Office of the Chief Information Officer to establish a centralized repository of data to capture, validate, and maintain information concerning an employee’s career that will ultimately affect retirement calculations. Retirement Services also established the capability to gather electronic data from the agency HR office and payroll service provider and send it to a centralized data repository. OPM has embarked on five major IT initiatives that should ultimately lead OPM to realize its IT strategic vision, including the Electronic Retirement Record, Retirement Data Repository, Data Bridge, Online Retirement Application, and Case Management System. These initiatives are at varying levels of completion. 9. PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR BENEFIT PROGRAMS Responsible Agency Officials • Juan Arratia, Director, Office of Procurement Operations • Gregory Blaszko, Division Director, Acquisition Policy & Innovation • Elijah Anderson, Division Director, Office of Procurement Operations The Office of Procurement Operations is responsible for soliciting, for evaluating and awarding agency contracts, orders, and agreements in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Office of Procurement Operations emphasizes the competitive 31 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report solicitation process, which helps the Government receive the best value. Issuing timely competitive solicitations for OPM’s benefits programs, specifically the BENEFEDS benefits portal, the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program, and the Flexible Spending Account Program, has been an agency challenge for several years. FY 2016 Progress Update The Office of Procurement Operations awarded, through full and open competition, a new FSAFEDS contract in March 2016 and a new Federal Long- Term Care contract in April 2016. The anticipated award date for the BENEFEDS procurement is FY 2017. In addition, in FY 2016, the Office of Procurement Operations initiated bi-weekly program reviews with OPM’s Healthcare and Insurance program office (which administers the benefits programs). The Office of Procurement Operations will continue to provide oversight and management support to the delegated Healthcare and Insurance procurement authority through the commencement of a file review and compliance check process based on developing polices and guidance. 10. PROCUREMENT PROCESS OVERSIGHT Responsible Agency Officials • Juan Arratia, Director, Office of Procurement Operations • Gregory Blaszko, Division Director, Acquisition Policy & Innovation • J.C. Thieme, Division Director, Office of Procurement Operations • Elijah Anderson, Division Director, Office of Procurement Operations OPM’s Office of Procurement Operations is responsible for providing centralized contract management that supports the operations and Government-wide mission of OPM, across the complete acquisition lifecycle, as well as directly supporting the agency suspension and debarment program, and managing the agency purchase card program. In FY 2015, OPM awarded nearly 4,200 transactions totaling $1.2 billion and in FY 2016, more than 3,000 transactions totaling $1.1 billion.In FY 2015, the Office of Procurement Operations took steps to determine areas for improvement by contracting with a consulting company to perform an independent strategic assessment of OPO’s procurement compliance, procurement oversight, workload and staffing, and acquisition certification and training. The consulting group issued a report of its findings, including 16 recommendations. OPM’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) validated these findings through an audit on July 8, 2016. FY 2016 Progress Update OPM’s Office of Procurement Operations has: • requested and received approval for 11 additional hires over previously approved staffing levels, reviewed benchmarks for similarly situated contracting offices to assess performance and staffing, and created and filled new senior positions to support procurement policy development and compliance/oversight functions; • developed and issued new contracting officer warrant policy and established an agency warrant module within the Federal Acquisition Institute T raining Application System (FAITAS), and continued ongoing efforts to better understand, manage, and oversee roles and responsibilities associated with contract administration functions performed within offices that have delegated procurement authority such as the Healthcare and Insurance program office; • developed and issued new policy and/or internal guidance in several other areas such as proper file documentation and maintenance, review and approval process, contract review board, acquisition planning, ratification of unauthorized commitments, and purchase card transaction review process; • begun collaboration with OPM’s Lean Six Sigma process improvement team on mapping the agency-wide end-to-end procurement process to identify solutions to address timeliness and quality issues; 32 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report• started monthly program reviews with all program offices to review current and planned procurement actions; and • developed training for both OPO and agency-wide staff in several critical areas to include for example small business subcontracting, the OPO review and approval process, contract review board process, contracting officer warrants, procurement ethics and source selection process, and OPM’s contract writing system. 1 1. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS Related Strategy and Agency Priority Goal • Strategy: 8.01 Enhance policy, procedures and processes used to ensure people are fit to serve • Agency Priority Goal: Background Investigations Responsible Agency Official • Charles S. Phalen, Jr., Director, National Background Investigations Bureau In January 2016, the Federal Government announced a series of changes to modernize and better secure the way it conducts investigations for Federal employees and contractors. Central to this announcement was work to establish a National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), a new entity that would have a strong national security focus, dedicated solely to the background investigations process. Although the NBIB is a division of OPM, the Department of Defense is responsible for the design, development, and security of NBIB’s IT systems.NBIB will have modernized business processes and tools, a new organizational model to bolster privacy and intergovernmental communications, and an updated governance structure that will better align policy and operations and facilitate continuous improvements. In FY 2016, OPM has met neither the timeliness targets established by the Director of National Intelligence nor the targets listed in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. In FY 2016, the agency completed (1) the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security clearance investigations in 123 days, exceeding the target of 40 days; (2) the fastest 90 percent of initial Secret national security investigations in 108 days, exceeding the target of 40 days; and (3) the fastest 90 percent of initial Top Secret national security investigations in 220 days, exceeding the target of 80 days. FY 2016 Progress Update On September 29, 2016, the Acting Director of OPM announced the appointment of Charles S. Phalen, Jr., as Director of NBIB. In order to reduce the backlog and improve the timeliness of background investigations, in FY 2016, OPM made 400 conditional offers of employment to Federal field investigators, and brought 363 onboard in FY 2016. OPM also awarded fieldwork contracts to two additional investigative service providers–increasing the number of contractors from two to four. This increased capacity should result in improvements to timeliness. 33 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals address the longstanding challenge of tackling horizontal problems across vertical organizational silos. These goals are a tool used by senior leadership to accelerate progress on a limited number of Presidential priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies. These goals are established or revised every four years based upon nominations solicited by OMB from Federal agencies and several Congressional committees. OPM is a co-leader of two CAP Goals: (1) People and Culture, and (2) Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform. People and Culture OPM is a co-leader of the CAP Goal for People and Culture. The three components of this CAP goal are (1) driving greater employee engagement; (2) building a world-class Federal management team, starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES); and (3) enabling agencies to recruit and hire the best talent. In FY 2016, OPM led efforts to drive employee engagement across agencies by increasing the number of Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) office-level reports available to managers through the Employee Viewpoint Survey Online Reporting and Analysis Tool and UnlockTalent.gov . Since 2009, the number of available reports to managers and supervisors increased from fewer than 1,000 to more than 26,000. In FY 2016, for the second year in a row, the Government-wide employee engagement and global satisfaction indices have risen by one percentage point, breaking a four-year decline. These results illustrate that employees across Federal agencies are more engaged in their workplaces and more satisfied with their jobs than they were a year ago. The results also show that what Federal employees said about their workplaces and their leaders matter. As a result of the survey, Federal Government leaders reviewed the data, set goals, and put in place initiatives that helped to improve employee engagement. 34 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportIn FY 2016, OPM worked aggressively to implement a 2015 Executive Order on Strengthening the Senior Executive Service and led efforts to implement reforms in the hiring, development, accountability, compensation, and recognition of SES and other Senior Leaders across the Federal Government. The Executive Order also created a Subcommittee of the President’s Management Council to advise OPM, members of the President’s Management Council, and the President on implementation of the order and additional ways to strengthen and improve the SES workforce. OPM worked with a group of agencies to pilot work plans to streamline SES hiring processes to help reduce the time to hire, and provided agencies with Qualifications Review Board process guidance and training. OPM also developed talent and succession processes and a talent and succession community of practice to provide organizational visibility into current and emerging talent across the enterprise. In addition, OPM worked with agencies to implement an improved cross-Government onboarding model, and improved SES development opportunities by expanding interagency rotation programs to all President’s Management Council agencies and interested regional areas. The specific accomplishments outlined below highlight the overall improved communication, sharing of best practices, and collaboration across agencies. • Agencies have developed plans to streamline their SES hiring processes. GSA and the Department of Energy successfully piloted resume-only applications for career executive positions, significantly cutting their overall time to hire. The Department of Energy shaved 90 days off their hiring timeline. • The Department of Defense also piloted a resume-only application process that further reduces the burden on applicants by decreasing requirements for applicants to initially provide information on technical qualifications in their applications. • OPM provided assistance to multiple agencies to develop and implement robust one-year SES onboarding programs to enhance support provided to new SES and other senior leaders. • Agencies are now required to provide their senior executives with a 360-degree developmental assessment every three years, an annual Executive Development Plan, and at least one annual developmental opportunity. • Agencies have prepared plans and committed to increasing the number of SES on rotational opportunities, to achieve a Government-wide goal of 15 percent of SES members on rotations. • Agencies have been asked to develop pay policies, with the objective of setting and adjusting basic rates of SES pay at levels above the pay rates of subordinate GS employees, to the extent feasible and consistent with applicable law. • Agencies were authorized to increase the aggregate spending pool for SES, Senior Level, and Scientific or Professional performance awards by 50 percent. • GSA and the Department of Interior are partnering with OPM to identify more streamlined methods of submitting materials sufficient to permit certification of SES candidates through the Qualifications Review Board process. They have identified an alternative that would reduce burden on applicants and agencies, potentially eliminating $2,000 in costs per candidate that some agencies incur to compile Qualifications Review Board materials. • OPM created a listserv and a central registry for individuals who have successfully completed SES Candidate Development Programs and have been certified as possessing requisite executive core qualifications to serve in senior executive positions. These tools will support a Community of Practice for SES Candidate Development Program graduates and also provide agencies across the Federal Government access to the noncompetitive hiring of SES candidates who are already certified by the Qualifications Review Board for initial appointment to the SES. • OPM created a robust talent management cycle that starts with an agency priorities discussion and includes 360-degree reviews of all OPM executives. • OPM is improving its Executive and Schedule C System IT system to help agencies collect data, build dashboards, and facilitate talent management and succession planning across Government. 35 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report • OPM piloted an expansion of the President’s Management Council Interagency Rotations program to support SES and field rotations. • OPM administered a Situational SES Mentoring Program, which provides any current SES member with access to a pool of experienced SES-level mentors who can provide advice and guidance on specific issues at no cost. • OPM administered a “Manager’s Corner” online portal with resources, guidance, and training solutions (such as online courses) for leadership training and development. • OPM led an interagency effort to design a model Senior Leader/Scientific or Professional performance appraisal system that incorporates legally-required components, reflects the needs and solutions of agencies, and incorporates best practices for an effective system. Subsequently, OPM also led an interagency effort to design an improved and streamlined senior employee performance appraisal system that reduces the administrative burden on agencies while significantly empowering agencies to assess and operate effective systems. To support agencies’ efforts to recruit and hire highly-qualified talent, OPM launched a nationwide “Hiring Excellence Campaign,” a series of 32 guidance sessions around the country and in virtual forums with Federal HR professionals and hiring managers, designed to provide technical assistance to help agencies better use existing hiring flexibilities and processes to hire the best talent. Ninety-two percent of participants rated the workshops positively. The average rating for participants who were satisfied with the workshop was 4.37 out of 5, and the average rating for participants who said they would recommend the workshop to a colleague was 4.36 out of 5. Approximately three months after attending a workshop, 74 percent of participants reported that they applied what they learned to their job. In addition, OPM piloted a series of enhancements to the USAJOBS resume mining tool which allows agencies to mine the database of searchable resumes to strategically recruit and match talent with open positions. The full release of the tool is expected in FY 2017.Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform (ITSCR) OPM serves as a co-leader of the Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform Cross-Agency Priority Goal to reduce the risks posed by insiders and improve security, suitability, and credentialing (SSC) processes. OPM’s Director plays a critical role in these reforms as the Suitability Executive Agent. The Director is responsible for the process and criteria by which candidates’ suitability for Federal employment is adjudicated. The Director is jointly responsible, with the Director of National Intelligence, for developing uniform and consistent policies and procedures for the effective, efficient, and timely completion of background investigations that form a basis for adjudications relating to suitability as well as national security. The Director also develops and issues the criteria for adjudicating eligibility for logical or physical access to Federal systems and facilities. The Director of OPM, as overseer of NBIB, is also responsible for 95 percent of the background investigations performed on behalf of the Federal Government. The Federal Government works to mitigate the inherent risks posed by employees and contractors with access to sensitive facilities, systems, and information, and to other personnel. Agencies collaborate on this effort through a Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC is the interagency body responsible for facilitating security, suitability, and credentialing reform across the Executive Branch. It is currently working toward accomplishment of the following five sub-goals: • equipping the workforce with the training and resources to responsibly report information; • improving process and policy modernization for personnel vetting; • developing secure and efficient information technology tools; • creating a continuous performance improvement model within the vetting community; and • establishing insider threat programs across the Government. 36 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportAs the Suitability Executive Agent, OPM’s Director serves as a permanent member of the PAC. OPM supports the PAC’s interagency Program Management Office and Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Line of Business, which help facilitate and implement reforms, by housing the organizations and providing necessary business support services. In FY 2016, OPM played a critical role in supporting this Cross-Agency Priority Goal. Building on years of work to construct a stronger and more effective background investigations process, the Federal Government announced in January 2016 the above-referenced changes to modernize and secure the way the Federal Government conducts investigations for Federal employees and contractors, including the establishment of the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). The NBIB was formally established on October 1, 2016. While the complete transition will take some time, the interagency team has made significant progress towards what will fundamentally strengthen this critical function. OPM has been working closely with DoD to develop and pilot a new, modern, and secure “eApplication” system to be utilized as an enterprise-wide shared service and replace OPM’s current application system (electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing). OPM, in its role as the Suitability Executive Agent and a core member of the PAC, has made significant progress in other key areas within this Cross-Agency Priority goal. • In March 2016, the PAC issued guidance on Executive Branch-wide requirements for issuing Personal Identity Verification Credentials and a suspension mechanism in accordance with a recommendation arising from a 2013 review that the President accepted. This guidance establishes a uniform set of criteria for issuance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials and the suspension of PIV credentials for all employees and contractors across the Executive Branch. OPM is working on more elaborate guidance to implement this direction.• In April 2016, the Director of OPM and the Director of National Intelligence approved the national Quality Assessment Standards Implementation Memorandum and Plan, which will enable the implementation of the investigative quality standards across the Federal Government. The Quality Assessment Standards were established in 2015 to facilitate the measurement and continued improvement of investigative quality across the Executive branch. • In May 2016, OPM and ODNI jointly issued 5 CFR 1400, “Designation of National Security Positions in the Competitive Services, and Related Matters,” which provides uniform and consistent guidance and procedures for designating national security sensitive positions. • In July 2016, OPM contributed to the approval of the PAC Strategic Intent, which established a unified five-year strategic vision across the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing mission. • In September 2016, the Security and Suitability Executive Agents issued an authorizing memorandum and established business rules implementing electronic adjudicative business rules for Tier 3 cases to enhance reciprocal acceptance of adjudicative decisions across the executive branch. • OPM played a critical role in the approval and modification of several questions to standard security/suitability forms related to mental health approved in November 2016. Other CAP Goals OPM also currently contributes to the following CAP Goals: Customer Service, Smarter IT Delivery, Open Data, Benchmark and Improve Mission Support Operations, and Category Management. Per the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act requirement to address Cross-Agency Priority Goals in the agency Strategic Plan, the Annual Performance Plan, and the Annual Performance Report, please refer to Performance.gov for the agency’s contributions to these goals and progress where applicable. 37 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS An Agency Priority Goal (APG) is a near-term result or achievement that agency leadership wants to accomplish within approximately 24 months that relies predominantly on agency implementation as opposed to budget or legislative accomplishments. APGs help the agency advance progress toward longer-term outcomes. OPM’s APGs covering FY 2016‒FY 2017 are as follows: APG Related OPM StrategiesMeasures 1.

OPM gauges its progress towards implementing each strategy using one or more performance measures or, in instances where the agency cannot express a performance goal in a quantifiable form, with milestones. The agency compares actual performance to targets. Conte xtual measures are highly influenced by external factors and, therefore, OPM has not set targets. In other instances, noted with the phrase Establish Baseline , measures are new and there are no baseline data. In those cases, OPM has deferred setting firm targets until enough data are collected to set ambitious but achievable targets. The tables that follow display performance results, ordered by strategic goal, for FY 2012-FY 2016. FY 2012-FY 2013 results precede the current strategic plan, but are included to show long-term trends. T rends are visualized in small charts that represent the FY 2012-FY 2016 results, subject to data availability. Note that the scales of the charts are not displayed, and they are automatically adjusted to “zoom in” on the data. This can have the effect of making small changes appear more dramatic, and large changes appear less significant. In the next section, OPM explains any variances or trends, identifies successful or promising practices relative to the performance targets, and, where targets were not met, describes plans for improvement. Please refer to the specific table numbers that follow for additional details, including explanations of the results. 39 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Strategic Goal 1: Attract and

Agency Priority Goal measure 49 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report PERFORMANCE DETAILS STRATEGIC GOAL 1: ATTRACT AND ENGAGE A DIVERSE AND EFFECTIVE OPM WORKFORCE Strategy 1.01: Deploy agile recruitment and outreach tactics to attract a diverse and talented workforce FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM hiring managers continued to receive support for recruiting efforts. For example, Federal Investigative Services managers participated with OPM Human Resources staff in a job fair for returned Peace Corps volunteers who are eligible for non-competitive appointments. Continuing the focus on collaborative recruitment, OPM provided employee resource groups with weekly lists of all job opportunities to distribute to their members and partners. Additionally, OPM shared job opportunities with all OPM employees through a weekly agency-wide email, to promote awareness of internal growth opportunities. OPM also continued to review applicant flow data (demographic data that may include an applicant’s race, national origin, disability, or gender) to identify and address any barriers to hiring a diverse workforce. In FY 2016, the agency established a new workforce dashboard, which incorporates applicant flow data and is accessible by all hiring managers. Additionally, OPM’s internal Diversity and Inclusion Council established a workgroup focused on “problem identification,” which analyzed a broad range of relevant workforce data to identify any challenges to the diversity of OPM’s workforce. 50 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 1.01 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of USA Staffing® hiring actions for which OPM managers reviewed applicant flow data FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* 82.1% 66.1% 100% ≥75% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM managers reviewed applicant flow data for 768 of 768 USA Staffing® hiring actions. The agency provided all OPM managers with continuously available access to applicant flow data in FY 2016. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. Strategy 1.02: Create a work environment where OPM employees are fully engaged and energized to put forth their best efforts and achieve OPM’s mission FY 2016 Progress Update During FY 2016, OPM continued to emphasize the importance of engaging employees in collaborative problem-solving to improve individual and organizational success. Each agency subcomponent engages a diverse group of employees in Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey action planning to improve employee engagement and agency outcomes. Each group works throughout the year on an improvement plan. For example, OPM formed a team that has pursued a Compassionate, Accurate, Responsive, and Empowered (CARE) customer service model that has informed OPM’s corporate approach to customer service. All OPM supervisors have performance standards that address expectations concerning diversity, inclusion, and engagement. Supervisors who are in challenging situations, based on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and other data, have been included in an ongoing Supervisor Support Program whereby diversity, inclusion, and other technical assistance training is provided to improve supervisory success.To increase collaborative problem-solving, OPM continues to provide training on Human Centered Design and Lean Six-Sigma to employees. OPM continues to promote Rapid Improvement Exercises, where employees are asked for ideas to improve OPM, and selected employees are given dedicated time and training to pursue their ideas such as energy savings and corporate sustainability issues. In FY 2016, OPM established three new employee resource groups to promote employee engagement and improved outcomes for the agency. The agency established a new African American employee resource group, Professionals Working Remotely (to help improve inclusion and engagement among employees who work in remote locations outside the immediate Washington, D.C. area), and Feds With Disabilities. Employee resource groups assist with the leadership development of OPM employees, and assist the agency in strategic outreach and recruitment. OPM continues to promote the 20 Small Acts of Inclusion, which are 20 actions, based on neuroscience, that increase behaviors that lead to the perception of inclusion, which is a key element to improve employee engagement. OPM also continues the Diversity and Inclusion Dialogues program which promotes open and honest conversations to improve communication, understanding, and teamwork among employees from different offices, backgrounds, and groups. 51 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 1.02A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: OPM’s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey Employee Engagement Index score FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 71% 72% 72% 71.1% 71.3% ≥73% Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM conducted the survey between May 5 and June 16, 2016. With 3,196 survey respondents, the response rate was 68 percent. While OPM's overall employee engagement score remained at 71, most major components improved. Gains in Employee Services, Human Resources Solutions, Retirement Services, Merit System Accountability and Compliance, Healthcare and Insurance, Planning and Policy Analysis and the Office of the Chief Information Officer were offset by the Federal Investigative Services' (FIS) score, which decreased by two points from 71 to 69. FIS, much of which is now the National Background Investigations Bureau, constituted approximately half of the OPM workforce. In 2016, there were more responses from FIS (1,707) than from all other OPM offices combined (1,489) ‒affecting OPM’s overall engagement score. For the first time since 2013, the overall OPM engagement score is not the same as the FIS engagement score. After more than a year of uncertainty, the transition to the National Background Investigations Bureau provides an opportunity to improve the engagement of roughly half of the OPM workforce.

OPM conducted the survey between May 5 and June 16, 2016. With 3,196 survey respondents, the response rate was 68 percent. The overall agency-wide result remained at 64 percent for the fourth consecutive year. However, every New IQ sub-index increased. New IQ sub-indexes: • Fair improved by 1 percentage point to 54 percent from 53 percent in FY 2015. • Open improved by 1 percentage point to 63 percent from 62 percent in FY 2015. • Cooperative improved by 2 percentage points to 60 percent from 58 percent in FY 2015. • Supportive improved by 1 percentage points to 85 percent from 84 percent in FY 2015. • Empowered improved by 1 percentage points to 61 percent from 60 percent in FY 2015. 52 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportStrategy 1.03: Provide targeted learning and developmental opportunities for OPM employees FY 2016 Progress Update During FY 2016, OPM launched a Supervisory Support Program. Throughout the year, the program provided leadership and engagement soft skills assessments and training, individualized coaching, and HR advisory services. A cohort of 60 supervisors across the agency and country participated. 89.5 percent of participants indicated that they would recommend the program to other supervisors. The agency also revitalized its New Supervisor Boot Camp, doubling the number of sessions offered to provide more opportunities for new supervisors to attend. During FY 2016, OPM made improvements to the Mentoring Program and increased matched pairs from 11 to 51, an increase of 364 percent. OPM had 23 matches on a shadow day event, with an 89 percent satisfaction rate. At the beginning and end of the fiscal year, the agency held workshops for both employees and supervisors on effective career development conversations. Most of the mission critical technical training is coordinated by individual organizations within OPM. Over the past few years, OPM has added a corporate approach to learning and development. Certain functions such as internal training and development policy, and management of the learning management system are corporately managed. With limited funds for training delivery, however, there is tension between the need for organization specific technical skills and the need for broader competencies like problem-solving and customer service that support agency-wide success. The agency continues to reevaluate and rebalance this function and the associated funding to ensure the workforce has the skills needed to accomplish the agency’s mission.

OPM Learning provided a broad range of opportunities in FY 2016, from online skills training to career development and soft skill courses. The courses taken covered a variety of different developmental themes and were not required by the agency, which indicates a strong career development commitment. In FY 2015, many OPM employees were required to complete one or more courses (for example, the ART of Customer Service) offered through the Learning Management System, resulting in an unusually high participation rate. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 53 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 1.03B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of employees satisfied with the opportunity to improve their skills as reported in the Employee Viewpoint Survey FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 63% 65% 62% 64% 67% ≥65% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM conducted the survey between May 5 and June 16, 2016. With 3,196 survey respondents, the response rate was 68 percent. Of the respondents, 2,141 of 3,196 employees reported that they were satisfied with the opportunity to improve their skills. While OPM saw a three percentage point positive improvement from 2015, the agency aims to continue to improve in 2017 by delivering training based on the core competencies identified by OPM managers, in addition to providing the supervisory support program, management exploration program, and mentoring program. The agency is also committing to provide employees with access to 40 hours of continuing learning. Following OPM’s FY 2015 release of its first Customer Experience Strategic Plan, which established a framework that allowed each office within the agency to tailor its efforts to the unique experiences of that office’s customers and scale select efforts, as applicable, across OPM, the agency focused in FY 2016 on implementing the “Find and Fix” performance improvement approach. This approach is a method of identifying areas of improvement and opportunities, analyzing options for solutions, developing action plans, implementing and tracking action plans, measuring effectiveness of action items, and communicating improvements to improve customer experiences. During FY 2016, offices continued to establish customer service metrics to help identify areas of improvement and opportunities for their Find and Fix action plans. Several offices submitted their initial Find and Fix action plans by the end of FY 2016. During the National Customer Service Week in October 2015, the agency promoted The ART of Customer Service course. By the end of National Customer Service Week, participation in the course increased by 3.3 percent.STRATEGIC GOAL 2: PROVIDE TIMELY, ACCURATE, AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE THAT ADDRESSES THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS Strategy 2.01: Develop and implement a strategic plan for customer service that addresses each of our major program goals FY 2016 Progress Update 54 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportThe agency continued to invest in and reward employees through the FY 2016 Director’s Awards for Excellence in Customer Service and submitted two nominations for the President’s Award for Customer Service. Offices encountered some challenges in developing customer service metrics. Lack of funding for an enterprise survey tool delayed the creation of surveys by some offices. Other offices had survey tools but did not receive a sufficient number of survey responses for quantitative analyses. Offices that developed surveys for public customers must follow Paperwork Reduction Act processes, which have delayed administration for some surveys until FY 2017.

OPM marketed the course during National Customer Service Week in October 2015, contributing to the increase. The agency focused on refining the customer service course, originally developed during FY 2015, and developing a new course and customer service resource page on the centralized Learning Management System platform. In December 2015, OPM administered a survey to all employees who had completed the customer service course. More than 400 employees provided feedback, which was used to make improvements and develop a new training course, The ART of Customer Service 102: People and Language. This course focused on tips for providing more responsive service to diverse customers and using plain language. Throughout FY 2016, OPM refined the course and therefore did not market it. OPM will continue marketing the refined course throughout FY 2017 to increase participation rates. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 55 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Strategy 2.02: Promote shared accountability for the customer service strategy FY 2016 Progress Update During the National Customer Service Week in October 2015, the agency continued communicating OPM’s Customer Experience Strategic Plan to more employees. In FY 2016, OPM created a joint internal customer survey to assess each office’s customer service with internal OPM customers. Implementation of this survey in FY 2017 will enhance shared accountability for the customer service strategy. OPM continued its participation in the Customer Service Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal Community of Practice, which provides a forum for agencies to share best practices, discuss challenges, and showcase new initiatives. In FY 2016, the CAP Goal also created a Core Federal Services Council to convene senior leaders of core public-facing Federal programs in order to share resources and best practices, address common challenges, serve as a Federal forum to use tools and feedback data, use economies of scale, and identify policy recommendations. USAJOBS and Retirement Services participated in this Council. OPM also promoted shared accountability for the Customer Experience Strategic Plan by working with Goal 2 project managers in each office to develop Accuracy, Responsiveness, and Timeliness (ART) measures as part of their Find and Fix action planning. However, developing questions that measured accuracy, responsiveness, and timeliness proved to be challenging because questions for these measurements were less common than satisfaction questions on existing surveys.

Strategy 2.03: Improve IT capabilities to interface with customers FY 2016 Progress Update OPM’s commitment to accurate, responsive, and timely customer service and enhancing customer experiences extends to electronic platforms such as websites and other online resources. OPM continued its IT improvements through website and web application updates. OPM updated eQIP (investigation application) to version 3.21 and transitioned all customers to a new messaging system with enhanced security. In FY 2016, USA Staffing® migrated 34 agencies to the upgraded version. The new version of USA Staffing® reduces time spent on transactional tasks through streamlined navigation. It includes full workflow management and tracking capabilities, provides a clear and mobile-friendly application process, and optimizes integration with USAJOBS. The focus on data analytics and interoperability will allow agencies to understand and refine their hiring processes over time. 57 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report In FY 2016, OPM used human-center design techniques to research and test seven production releases of the next generation of USAJOBS. OPM implemented the following updates: (1) a responsive, mobile-friendly website; (2) application process redesign; (3) global user interface and Job Opportunity Announcement updates; (4) global navigation and Help Center redesign; (5) bug fixes; (6) a profile redesign; and (7) a new landing page. OPM delivered seven releases for the Agency Talent Portal that included data self-service, a Job Opportunity Announcement Analytics dashboard, and resume mining enhancements. USAJOBS also tackled several infrastructure projects. These projects included continuous integration to implement automated testing into all new releases, zero downtime releases, and plans to incorporate the groundwork for future DevOps capabilities, such as infrastructure as a code with automated deployments. After the launch of the UnlockTalent.go v website in July 2015, in FY 2016 OPM used feedback from Federal employees to make improvements to the site and registration experience.OPM also updated the Frequently Asked Questions section of opm .gov, including updating FAQs on benefits for LGBT Federal employees and annuitants based on legal and policy changes. In addition to posting updated 2016 Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program and Federal Employees Dental/Vision Program (FEDVIP) plan brochures on opm .gov, OPM updated the Plan Comparison Tool with additional navigation features, sorting capability, and display changes. Also in FY 2016, OPM enhanced its virtual training by hosting multiple virtual seminars and webcasts, including a Benefits Officers Network webcast and a two-day Federal Benefits Virtual Seminar. OPM launched a Hiring Toolkit on Human Resources University (HRU) and added a Hiring Excellence webpage on opm .gov as a supplement to its in-person training sessions. In January 2016, HRU.gov surpassed the $150 million training resources savings benchmark through its centralized online platform.

OPM hosted a panel on benefits for LGBT Federal employees and annuitants, providing benefit information based on legal and policy changes to nearly 2,000 attendees and hundreds more through the recording on YouT ube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0As-ESLdsA&feature=youtu.be) . During Open Season 2015, OPM held webcasts, a Virtual Town Hall and released a video series that included typical FEHB, FEDVIP , and FSAFEDS information, as well as a series of videos about the new Self Plus One option. The Virtual Town Hall and video series received more than 7,000 views. In September 2016, OPM held a webcast on 2016 Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfO2x1Xc5uE ) with more than 30,000 views. In FY 2016, OPM continued to provide in-person training to supplement its virtual training. OPM hosted a Cyber Talent Summit covering hiring authorities; recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives; the National Science Foundation’s Scholarship for Service; and panel discussions. OPM held an FEHB Carrier Conference to provide information on FEHB policies and procedures so the agency’s FEHB Carriers can better serve enrollees. OPM offered 912 delegated examining and evaluator training classes for HR professionals to enhance their understanding of policies and procedures that apply throughout their administration of delegated examining at their agency. OPM also traveled to 22 cities as part of its Hiring Excellence campaign to hone skills that will help agencies recruit and hire top talent from across America. More than 3,000 supervisors and human resource professionals attended these forums. A continuing challenge to the implementation of this strategy will be the ability to communicate policy and procedure information in language understandable by HR specialists, Federal employees and retirees, the public, and OPM’s other customers. To mitigate this challenge, OPM included basic plain language tips in The ART of Customer Service 102: People and Language course and provided additional plain language resources in the Customer Service Resources page on the agency-wide learning management system. 59 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 2.04 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of Strategy 2.04 milestones from the Customer Experience Strategic Plan completed FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A* 50% 54.5% ≥10 % Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: By the end of FY 2016, OPM cumulatively completed 12 of 22 Strategy 2.04 milestones from the FY 2015-2018 OPM Customer Experience Strategic Plan.

Throughout FY 2016, OPM proactively conducted demonstrations for various agencies and organizations, conducted focus groups to gather feedback on the current content, received initial feedback on the features that were launched at the end of the fiscal year, and held webinars targeted to diverse audiences on the updates to UnlockTalent.gov . OPM added additional content to UnlockTalent.gov that targeted different levels of an agency hierarchy–from line-employees, to supervisors and managers, to Senior Executive Service members. Finally, OPM established a point of contact for UnlockTalent.gov at each agency to gain a better understanding of each agency’s specific needs for the online data visualization tool. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. Strategy 3.03: Develop partnerships to access and analyze data FY 2016 Progress Update OPM, in partnership with the School of Public Affairs at American University, hosted the inaugural 2016 OPM Research Summit, dedicated to connecting research and policy. The Summit showcased peer-reviewed published research and brought together more than 150 academic researchers, Federal practitioners, and industry partners to exchange ideas, collaborate, and participate in critical conversations about research and policy in areas such as work/life programs, benefits, performance management, leadership, employee focus, and diversity and inclusion. Researchers and others discovered new solutions, learned from best practices, and gained a better understanding of how to incorporate research and data into policy-decision making. For additional information, please refer to https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/human-capital-management/opm-research-summit/ . OPM also hosted a half-day, roundtable discussion on synthetic data–a cutting-edge data disclosure method. This data roundtable brought together experts from Duke University, the Census Bureau, and OPM to discuss synthetic data techniques that their respective teams have developed. Further, OPM led the skills gap interagency workgroup and provided group and one-on-one technical assistance to all CHCO Act agencies, to prepare them to conduct their root cause analyses of skills gaps within their mission critical occupations. 62 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 3.03 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Number of signed research agreements with academic institutions, professional associations, think tanks, or industry FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A* 2 2 ≥5 Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: The agency’s development of a standardized process for research agreements proved to be difficult. Initially, OPM sought to enter into agreements across multiple sectors (that is, academic, private sector, industry, etc.), but this resulted in privacy concerns for certain types of data. Based on these concerns, in FY 2016, OPM implemented a standardized process, focusing efforts solely on academic research partnerships. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. Strategy: 3.04 Make data analytics a fundamental part of OPM culture FY 2016 Progress Update OPM’s employees led noteworthy original research in FY 2016 that resulted in the publication of 10 articles and white papers, a book, and 35 conference presentations. In addition, in FY 2016, OPM completed the development, administration, and analysis of the HRStat Maturity Model Assessment Tool, and hosted the inaugural Human Capital Analytics Symposium, which emphasized how to make data-driven decisions for operations, as well as human capital business processes.

OPM partnered with interagency working groups to develop 109 Government-wide Talent Development, 76 Employee Performance Management, and 50 Work Schedule and Leave Management business requirements that establish baseline service expectations for Shared Services Providers. Pending the approval and publication of the Business Reference Model 3.0, which is currently in legal review, these documents will be made available Government-wide. In addition, the HR Line of Business (HR LOB) created a change control process for Business Reference Model business requirements to support the capacity of published requirements to evolve to meet agency needs. OPM also worked with the General Services Administration (GSA) to map human capital spend categories with the GSA Schedule 738x (which features a full array of pre-qualified, professional HR service providers) and the HC Category Hallway to the Business Reference Model 3.0 framework to align Government-wide acquisition strategy and promote transparency. OPM also laid the groundwork for a Government-wide data standardization and exchange model by delivering an HC Master Data Roadmap, developing use case model examples for data exchanges, creating the conceptual architecture, and mapping of National Information Exchange Model Core data to HC Master Data, Notice of Personnel Action (SF-50), and Request for Personnel Action (SF-52) data. OPM will continue to build upon these successes in FY 2017, thereby laying the foundation for increased interoperability between disparate HC IT systems and improving the timeliness and accuracy of interagency data exchanges. In FY 2016, OPM and GSA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to transition the oversight of Shared Service Providers to the newly created United Shared Services Management governance structure. 64 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 4.01A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of Federal Human Capital Data Model with standards published FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* 0% 1.37% 1.37% ≥15% Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM has published National Information Exchange Model data standards for 24 of 1,757 data elements in the HR lifecycle. During the first half of FY 2015, OPM's HR LOB met with its stakeholders and customers to determine the strategic direction of the program. This meeting resulted in a decision to focus on updating the Business Reference Model 3.0 Framework. As a part of this decision, the publication of data elements to the National Information Exchange Model HR Domain will be incorporated into the overarching Business Reference Model update initiative. OPM will resume working on the activities associated with this measure in FY 2017 and will leverage the lessons learned from earlier implementation efforts. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

Similar to the publication of Federal Human Capital Data Model measure, the identification of additional automation opportunities is subsumed into the Business Reference Model 3.0 Framework initiative. This decision was based on input from the HR LOB stakeholders and customers. In FY 2016, OPM defined a new measure to track the publication of standards for the Business Reference Model 3.0 Framework and will continue to publish the standards in FY 2017 . The publication schedule was developed in consultation with the HR LOB stakeholders and customers. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 65 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Strategy 4.02: Implement enabling successful practices and initiatives that strengthen IT leadership and IT governance FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM continued to build on the governance-related activities initiated in FY 2015. As reported in FY 2015, OPM revived the Investment Review Board to increase senior leadership’s involvement in Information Technology (IT) policy and strategic decision-making. In FY 2016, OPM conducted five Board meetings to address several of the Office of the Chief Information Officer’s (OCIO) proposed investments and strategic direction. The Board approved the OCIO’s proposed FY 2016-2018 strategy and direction, as well as the recommendations from the analyses of alternatives from two investments: (1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Data Center Consolidation; and (2) the Consolidated Business Information System. OPM also began to roll out its program to implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). OPM developed its FITARA Action Plan, issued its FITARA Implementation Memo, and updated its processes for CIO review and approval of all IT acquisitions.OPM also created application profiles for all business applications or application suites. These profiles include information such as system reliability, security rating, and cost of modernization. The information found on the application profiles will be used in Analyses of Alternatives that OPM will conduct in future modernization strategies. To strengthen IT leadership in FY 2016, OPM hired new senior executives, including Associate Chief Information Officers and senior IT program managers. The addition of these senior leaders brings to bear the proper level of experience, expertise, and rigor as OPM continues to identify effective and efficient ways to utilize information technology to support its mission. In addition, OPM started the implementation of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library practices and procedures, which focus on aligning IT services with the needs of OPM operations. OPM commenced the Library implementation by providing an agency-wide Library Foundation training. The training is the first in a series of courses that will help OPM implement industry best practices for IT service delivery.

In FY 2016, OPM merged three major investments into one by consolidating the Enterprise Case Management System and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) investments with the Enterprise Infrastructure Operations investment. This consolidation reduced the number of certified IT program managers because the IT program managers for the case management and IaaS investments were Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers Level III certified, while the IT program manager for the Enterprise Infrastructure Operations investment was not certified. In FY 2016, OPM hired several new IT program managers who, while possessing extensive program management experience, have not completed the necessary certification process. OPM will work to get the IT program managers certified in FY 2017 in order to meet the target for this measure. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 66 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportStrategy 4.03: Implement enterprise initiatives that leverage capabilities and tools throughout OPM FY 2016 Progress Update OPM’s Investment Review Board approved the recommendation from the IaaS Data Center Consolidation Analysis of Alternatives to consolidate the number of OPM data centers from nine to two. OPM developed the Analysis as part of its effort to comply with the OMB’s Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative. OPM has started the data center consolidation effort, and has completed the move out of one data center, and will vacate a second data center in Q1 of FY 2017. During this consolidation, OPM continues to plan and prepare for system migrations.OPM security operations implemented capabilities to strengthen the security of the overall environment in support of a new defense-in-depth architecture, including enrolling in the Einstein 3‒Accelerated program to further increase visibility and to detect and block potential incidents. Also, OPM became the first agency to implement Phase 1 capabilities of the DHS Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) program. OPM continues to work towards the second phase of the CDM program to support trust in people granted access, security-related behavior, credentials and authentication, and privilege management. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement.

The response rate was 26.1 percent, with 5,509 respondents. In FY 2016, OPM sustained a rating of 3 (satisfied) for nine months, and 4 (highly satisfied) for four months with a satisfaction rate range of 85 percent to 91 percent. The yearly average was 88 percent satisfied. While OPM did not meet the target for this fiscal year, OPM did not have a month where respondents were not satisfied or highly satisfied. For the first 6 months of the year, the Help Desk escalated tickets that were not resolved within 15 minutes. OPM made a decision to remove this requirement, contributing to higher call wait times, but yielding higher first contact resolution rates, quicker restoration of access and utilization to affected systems, and decreased front-line service demand placed on system administration and development technical experts. OPM also experienced several system outages during early morning work hours that resulted in high volume call surges throughout the year, which affected call wait times and call answer speed. In FY 2017 , OPM plans to develop a strategic improvement plan for further improving the Help Desk. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 67 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 4.03B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: IT security compliance rating for OPM infrastructure services FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A*1 Unsecure1 Unsecure (As of June 2016) ≥4 Highly SecureNot Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: This measure was established before OPM's successful implementation of the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program and is no longer representative of OPM's progress in securing the agency’s systems and data. In FY 2016, OPM was recognized by DHS as one of the first agencies to fully implement CDM. As reported for OPM's Cybersecurity Agency Priority Goal, OPM met its FY 2016 target of 95 percent coverage for Phase 1 CDM controls, along with its Q4 FY 2016 FISMA Compliance and High Value Assets encryption targets. In addition, OPM achieved 100 percent PIV enforcement for its internal users for OPM network access. Other cybersecurity improvements in FY 2016 include the hiring of additional Information Systems Security Officers, awarding a contract for additional Federal Information Security Management Act compliance support, upgrading email security gateways to provide additional security functionality, actively participating in the DHS Cyber Hygiene Initiative to address known vulnerabilities in accordance with the OMB Memorandum 15-01 Binding Operational Directives, and implementing a Network Access Control solution across the enterprise to prevent unauthorized operating platforms from accessing the network environment.

AGENCY PRIORITY GOAL: CYBERSECURITY MONITORING Goal Statement: Continue enhancing the security of OPM’s information systems by strengthening authentication and expanding the implementation of continuous monitoring. OPM will enhance the use of two-factor authentication in multiple ways. By August of FY 2015, 99 percent of OPM users were required to use Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication for network access and the remaining one percent was enforced by the end of October 2015. By the end of FY 2016, 80 percent of non-OPM users who have a PIV card will be required to authenticate to OPM applications using their PIV cards. By the end of FY 2017, OPM will enforce two-factor authentication for 100 percent of all PIV-enabled users and 80 percent of non-PIV-enabled users. OPM will enhance its security posture by expanding on the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) capabilities implemented throughout FY 2015. The CDM program enables OPM to expand continuous diagnostic capabilities by increasing the network sensor capacity, automating sensor collections, and prioritizing risk alerts. By the end of the second quarter of FY 2016, OPM will have acquired and implemented four CDM controls including vulnerability assessment, continuous monitoring, hardware asset management, and software asset management. These tools should increase OPM’s ability to identify and respond to security issues. By the end of FY 2016, OPM will have fully implemented dashboard capabilities allowing OPM to benchmark its CDM program with other Federal agencies. In FY 2017, OPM will use the benchmarking results to identify and prioritize the implementation of other CDM controls. OPM will continue to pursue a number of additional actions as outlined in its Cybersecurity Monitoring goal. 69 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report FY 2016 Progress Update OPM continued its Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) implementation plan. OPM implemented all CDM tools for Phase 1 and is preparing for Phase 2. During the implementation of CDM tools in Phase 1, OPM awaited requirements from DHS on the Federal dashboard and resolved issues with the OPM dashboard and data feeds. Once completed, the OPM dashboard will display real-time status from the sensors provided by the CDM toolset. In Q4, OPM exceeded its target of 95 percent of its network covered by CDM Phase 1. OPM has started the configuration of the Federal Compliance module, which will be used to manage Assessment and Authorization activities and reporting. During Q4, OPM transferred Identity Management implementation responsibilities to its cybersecurity team in order to bring the skillset, experience and expertise from within the cybersecurity team to bear on this important project. OPM continued to work with the OIG on addressing Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) audit findings and towards that end, in FY 2016, OPM launched two major IT system compliance initiatives. By the end of FY 2016, 67.4 percent of OPM IT systems had current authorities to operate. In addition, the cybersecurity team has established a Plan of Actions and Milestones Management Review Board to facilitate improved consistency in management decisions on the creation, review, update, closure and cancellation of Plan of Actions and Milestones. On August 25, the OPM Investment Review Board approved the Infrastructure as a Service Analysis of Alternatives, which recommended that OPM consolidate the nine data centers that it currently operates to two strategic locations in Macon, GA and Boyers, PA. OPM has built the IaaS capability and is conducting configuration/testing of systems moving into it as part of its Data Center Initiative. OPM has started the data center consolidation effort, and has completed the move out of one data center, and will vacate a second data center in Q1 of FY 2017.

Strategy 4.04: Implement business initiatives that provide capabilities spanning the HR life cycle, allowing OPM and other Federal agencies to achieve their missions FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM continued its support of customer agencies across the HR lifecycle with several initiatives. For applicants, the USAJOBS program continued its work to deliver the next generation of USAJOBS with the implementation of seven production releases. Improvements to the USAJOBS system included the implementation of a responsive, mobile-friendly website, redesign of the application process, global navigation, a Help Center, and a new landing page. For the background investigation community, OPM provided technical and functional support for the establishment of OPM’s new National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). As noted above, NBIB will be the primary provider of background investigations for the Federal Government. As part of the NBIB roll out, OPM successfully provisioned the NBIB.gov domain, email accounts, and an NBIB Help Desk. For current employees, the electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) program continued its support to agencies and providers. It provided guidance on system requirements, held regular meetings to promote agencies’ understanding of their responsibilities, and worked with form owners and HR policy owners to promote compliance.While not represented in the satisfaction rating measure listed in Table 4.04A, the Human Resources Solutions (HRS) IT Program Management Office, which manages systems such as USAJOBS, USA Staffing®, USA Performance, and Employee Express, achieved an American Customer Satisfaction Index Score of 88, exceeding the Federal Government-wide benchmark of 63.9. In addition, 100 percent of its customers indicated that they would recommend these services to other Federal agencies, and that the agency’s services contributed to their organization’s effectiveness and saved them time. In support of retirees and annuitants, OPM’s Retirement Services IT Program Management Office completed its Adaptable Data Base System data encryption, Retirement Services also supports the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) with the DATA Act’s requirements, and has completed 90 percent of its programming effort since Q3 FY 2016. Most importantly, the team was able to sustain 100 percent system availability during operational hours for Retirement Services Operations to support accurate and timely payments to Federal retirees and annuitants. In FY 2016, OPM successfully deployed the Executive & Schedule C System, which is used to store information about the Federal workforce and to generate the Plum Book, which is used during transitions between Presidential administrations. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement. 72 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 4.04A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Aggregate customer satisfaction rating with OPM IT business systems FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A*2.5 Below Standards2.5 Below Standards≥4 Highly SatisfiedNot Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: The eOPF customer satisfaction survey was administered quarterly. Total respondents in FY 2016 totaled 3,415, a response rate of 16.5 percent. For FY 2016, eOPF’s yearly average was 86 percent satisfied or very satisfied. eOPF’s lowest rating was 84 percent in Q2 FY 2016, and the program steadily improved to a Q4 high of 88 percent. The USAJOBS customer satisfaction survey was administered monthly. The response rate was 40.4 percent, with 8,560 respondents. The USAJOBS yearly customer satisfaction average was 74 percent. eOPF’s lowest rating occurred when the program implemented additional security measures in Q2 and has steadily improved over the last two quarters. In FY 2017, OPM will implement several initiatives to improve eOPF customers’ satisfaction, including enhanced instructional and operational guidance, improved record query, and better policy support from HR policy makers. USAJOBS will also focus on improving the customer experience, including the evaluation of all “touch points” (that is, the web, social media, and the Help Desk). In FY 2017, USAJOBS will implement a new search engine and user interface, re-design the job opportunity announcement, continue to identify key performance indicators for the end-to-end customer journey, and create digital campaigns to improve customer experience and increase engagement. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

In FY 2016, OPM was recognized by the DHS as one of the first agencies to fully implement CDM. As reported for OPM’s Cybersecurity Agency Priority Goal, OPM met its FY 2016 target of 95 percent coverage for Phase 1 CDM controls, along with its Q4 FY 2016 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Compliance and High Value Assets (HVA) encryption targets. In addition, OPM achieved 100 percent PIV enforcement for its internal users for OPM network access. Other cybersecurity improvements in FY 2016 include the hiring of addition Information Systems Security Officers, awarding a contract for additional FISMA compliance support, upgrading email security gateways to provide additional security functionality, actively participating in the DHS Cyber Hygiene Initiative to address known vulnerabilities in accordance with the OMB Memorandum 15-01 Binding Operational Directives, and implementing a Network Access Control solution across the enterprise to prevent unauthorized operating platforms from accessing the network environment. These results are as of the end of June FY 2016. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 73 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report STRATEGIC GOAL 5: ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN RESPONSIVE, TRANSPARENT BUDGETING AND COSTING PROCESSES Strategy 5.01: Implement cost re-baselining FY 2016 Progress Update OPM completed all planned actions under this strategy prior to FY 2016.

By the end of FY 2016, OPM awarded a contract to begin implementation of a Budget Management System, which is scheduled for deployment in FYs 2017-2018. The new system will improve processes and tools for budget formulation, performance management, and decision support analytics. This will aid in the analysis and prioritization of funding requirements. During FY 2016, OPM initiated efforts to develop an Executive View Dashboard for Office of the Chief Financial Officer performance reporting. This will allow enhanced access to data for programs, allowing agency senior leaders and stakeholders to better monitor, reconcile, and perform budget execution activities. In FY 2016, OPM completed work on the development of an improved open obligations report and agency strategic goal report. The planning for implementation for these reports will begin in the first quarter of FY 2017.

TABLE 5.02B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of stakeholders who agree that OPM's budget processes and activities are responsive to their needs Refer to Table 5.01B.Strategy 5.03: Widely inform key stakeholders on new agency budget process FY 2016 Progress Update OPM introduced new initiatives to inform agency stakeholders about the agency budget process. During FY 2016, OPM finalized and implemented a comprehensive Budget, Performance, and Finance training course to provide agency leaders with a broad view of Federal budgeting and related processes. This course covered budget formulation and execution, as well as performance management. The training was initially delivered to senior executives. T raining topics included (1) an overview of annual budget, (2) performance and finance requirements and deliverables, (3) timelines, and (4) terminology and guidance for completing related requirements. Future training will be facilitated at lower-levels. OPM also sought feedback from stakeholders to enhance OPM budget-related processes, tools, and information sharing. OPM developed and administered a customer satisfaction survey to agency employees who performed budget-related activities. Survey participants were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with current processes and activities. The survey results have been useful in determining where the agency can direct actions to increase knowledge and access to budget information and tools. The FY 2016 survey was the first iteration of this survey, which will become a regular tool to gather feedback from stakeholders. 75 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 5.03A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of stakeholders who agree that informaton about OPM's budget processes, activities and tools is communicated to users FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A* N/A* 49.2% Establish BaselineEstablish Baseline FY 2016 Analysis of Results: The survey was administered between February 3, 2016 and February 26, 2016.

This training was useful as the agency developed cost models and dashboards to demonstrate reporting capabilities. Strategy 5.04: Configure and deploy agency-wide cost accounting models FY 2016 Progress Update Regarding the configuration and deployment of Cost Accounting Models, significant progress was made during FY 2016 to further develop models and improve data reliability. Specifically in FY 2016, we accomplished the following: • refined the functional and support activities, and cost objects in the cost accounting model to support model data documentation and to increase cost granularity and transparency of the Enterprise-wide Managerial Cost Accounting (EMCA) Model Data Structure; • streamlined and aligned OPM’s EMCA activities to labor codes which provide a direct method for allocating labor costs to improve the traceability and the quality of the cost data; and • awarded a contract for the implementation and support of the Enterprise-wide Cost Accounting System implementation planned for FY 2019. 76 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 5.04A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Revolving Fund net income (three year rolling average) FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* $272,000,000 $125,000,000 $162,463,231 ≥$0 Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: FY 2016 results do not include credit monitoring activities. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

STRATEGIC GOAL 6: PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN HELPING AGENCIES CREATE INCLUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHERE A DIVERSE FEDERAL WORKFORCE IS FULLY ENGAGED AND ENERGIZED TO PUT FORTH ITS BEST EFFORT, ACHIEVE THEIR AGENCY’S MISSION, AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE Strategy 6.01: Design and deliver leadership training to increase employee engagement FY 2016 Progress Update OPM worked with agencies to incorporate people leadership elements into Senior Executive Service (SES) performance plans. These elements include agency workforce goals and metrics, including improvement targets related to employee engagement. OPM reviewed examples of performance plans to gain visibility into agency progress and posted them to UnlockTalent.gov .OPM cross-walked the Supervisory and Managerial Curriculum Framework released September 2015 to courses on OPM’s Manager Corner (on HRU .gov) to assist agencies in strengthening the leadership development programs. OPM continued to promulgate improvement in onboarding of senior executives through guidance supporting the December 2015 Executive Order 77 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report –Strengthening the Senior Executiv e Service. The guidance outlined the critical requirements and flexible framework that will guide agencies in providing the critical support to executives through their first year of service in new positions. OPM developed an online course, Maximizing Employee Engagement, designed to help educate and provide Federal leaders with knowledge and strategies to successfully support employee engagement–an objective consistently shown through workplace studies as a critical enabler of organizational success, financial performance, and positive human capital management outcomes in critical areas including recruitment and retention. The course is highly-interactive, integrating electronic job aids and activities to increase and enhance learning.

Thirty-three of 47 components of CHCO organizations increased their “leaders lead” scores. OPM encouraged agencies to share results with components and subcomponents and encourage action-planning below the department/agency level. Research has shown that change occurs best at the lower levels and the results seem to support that. In addition, many agencies identified leadership-related challenges as the action planning area of focus and, as a result, instituted efforts that involved improved leadership activity. Agencies placed an emphasis on leaders communicating with employees differently, more often, and more effectively. Agencies incorporated employee engagement in leaders’ performance plans, as well as provided leaders with training and development support with the goal of strengthening leadership competencies and skills. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. ~In FY 2016, the definition of components was changed to include only the selected components of the CHCO agencies that were identified in accordance with the 2014 joint OPM-OMB memorandum to agency heads on strengthening employee engagement and organizational performance (OMB-M-15-04). 78 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 6.01B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Number of participants who achieve mastery of competencies upon completion of the manager or executive level LEAD certificate program FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A* 20 9Establish BaselineEstablish Baseline FY 2016 Analysis of Results: In FY 2016, nine people received a LEAD Certificate at the Executive and Manager level. As of the end of the fiscal year, another seven had completed the coursework and were in the process of writing or waiting to receive a grade for their capstone requirement for the program. As individuals from different agencies sign up for the certificate programs, different factors influence completion of the certification processes. Some individuals sign up for courses and after taking two or three courses, decide they will continue and pursue the certificate program for their grade. We have seen enrollments rise in taking the individual courses that constitute the certificates but fewer opting to take the entire sequence for certifications. This is a function of factors impacting attendance and enrollments (that is, lack of enforcement of Executive Development Plans, Individual Development Plans, Succession Plan Development, and Workforce Planning in Federal agencies). Future improvements include increased promotional marketing of all certificate programs, reinforcement by the CHCOs to utilize OPM programs for continued professional development, and follow-up with previous certificate recipients regarding promotion in their agencies. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

The certificate programs cover a broad set of competencies. Certificate program participants have three years to complete certificate requirements and individuals who enroll in the various courses often take courses to address specific areas of learning and do not enroll in the certificate track. OPM has leadership modules that cover topics that impact engagement, and is proposing a course that specifically focuses on employee engagement. 79 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Strategy 6.02: Support agencies in hiring leaders strong in managing and leading high performing organizations FY 2016 Progress Update Building on a promising practice in the use of a situational judgment assessment in the managerial hiring process, OPM administered the Supervisory Situational Judgment Test via the USAHire platform for three different agencies in FY 2016: OPM, the Defense Logistics Agency, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These three agencies more than doubled their use of the test in FY 2016, assessing applicants for 280 job opportunity announcements in FY 2016 compared to 106 job opportunity announcements in FY 2015. OPM is also currently working with two additional agencies to prepare for implementation in FY 2017. OPM expects to continue to leverage and promulgate this process for managerial hiring to other Federal agencies in FY 2016. In addition, OPM began work on an executive assessment in FY 2016 that can be used Government-wide for executive hiring. In FY 2016, OPM conducted market research, including interviews with 19 private-sector organizations to determine best practices for executive assessment, and conducted subject matter expert and stakeholder panels with Executive Resources staff, new SES members, experienced SES members, and Qualifications Review Board members to gather input on and shape the assessment strategy. OPM also partnered with the National Academy Public Administration to host a thought leader discussion on principles, strategies, and recommendations for modernizing Federal executive talent management. Representatives from the private sector, academia, and good government groups provided input on SES talent management and executive hiring. OPM will expand the suite of executive assessments in FY 2017. OPM provided agencies guidance with information and tools to implement SES hiring and Qualifications Review Board submission methods that will serve as alternatives to the traditional methods commonly used. The guidance also provided information on streamlining initial SES hiring processes. OPM explored alternative methods of documenting executive qualifications during the agency hiring process (for example, video-based documentation) that could be used to satisfy the needs of Qualifications Review Board assessors, all of which could enable the selection of SES members without the traditional heavy reliance on written materials. To help support development of leadership skills and provide for broadening experiences, OPM expanded the Interagency Rotation Program to additional President’s Management Council agencies and interested regional areas through the Federal Executive Boards. OPM released two training courses entitled, “Emotionally Intelligent Leadership” and “Leading Change.” OPM developed these courses for cross-Governmental use as part of OPM’s strategic commitment to help agencies create inclusive work environments where the workforce is fully engaged. The courses are part of a collection of executive development tools and courses available to agencies to help meet requirements set forth in 5 CFR 412.202. OPM continued to promulgate improvement in onboarding of senior executives through guidance supporting the December 2015 Executive Order – Strengthening the Senior Executive Service. The guidance outlined the critical requirements and flexible framework that will guide agencies in providing the critical support to executives through their first year of service in new positions. OPM also worked with agencies to develop strategic talent management and succession planning programs as mandated in the Executive Order. OPM drafted guidance and highlighted agency promising practices through various forums. In accordance with section 3(a)(v) of the Executive Order, OPM also provided instructions for agencies to develop plans to increase the number of SES members on rotation to improve talent development, mission delivery, and collaboration. TABLE 6.02 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of components of CHCO organizations that increased “leaders lead” scores Refer to Table 6.01A. 80 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportStrategy 6.03: Provide a comprehensive suite of engagement services and models for agencies and employees FY 2016 Progress Update To maximize the UnlockTalent.gov user experience, OPM released many enhancements to the UnlockTalent.gov dashboard in FY 2016. OPM added two new levels of access, the Executive level and the Basic User level. The Executive Access provides executives and senior leaders with an additional level of data within their agency. The Basic User access allows Federal employees who work for agencies that do not participate in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to access the Community of Practice page and the HR Core Metrics page on UnlockTalent.gov . OPM also enhanced the navigational scheme of the site to make it easier for the user to access information, and created a demographic map on the public landing page to provide an additional benchmark showing what our workforce looks like throughout the country. As resources permit, OPM will continue to enhance the site by building out the HR Core Metrics page to include key metrics for agencies to benchmark across government, adding a feature that will allow for deeper analysis of the data, and enhancing the Community of Practice page to include a search feature and a discussion board. In addition to the enhancements, OPM continued its efforts to encourage the use of UnlockTalent.gov as a tool for engagement. In FY 2016, OPM established UnlockTalent.gov points of contact at each agency to increase the effectiveness of the distribution of communication and briefed the Chief Human Capital Officers Council on upcoming changes to the site. OPM also held focus groups and conducted user testing to determine what agencies want from UnlockTalent.gov and how they want it. OPM also spoke to various groups and agencies about how to use UnlockTalent.gov as a tool to make data-driven decisions, and is currently working to develop a communication strategy to drive users to UnlockTalent.gov . Through the enhancements and improvements for UnlockTalent.gov , OPM is maximizing the user’s experience and making UnlockTalent.gov a meaningful tool as agencies continue to find ways to increase their employee engagement. Building on foundational research work in FY 2015 on employee engagement, OPM published and disseminated a white paper on employee engagement entitled, “Engaging the Federal Workforce: How To Do It & Prove It” that put forth a common definition and model for measuring and influencing employee engagement across Government. This research was and will continue to be used to shape OPM’s policy, oversight, and services with regard to employee engagement. To further disseminate this work, OPM conducted an employee engagement webinar series, which was open to all Federal employees. The series consisted of eight webinars designed to promulgate a framework of employee engagement that can be modeled across agencies, as well as resources and ‘how to’ information to support agencies and managers in understanding how to make a difference in increasing employee engagement in their organizations. 81 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 6.03A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of CHCO Act agencies that access the Employee Viewpoint Survey Online Reporting and Analysis Tool FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* N/A* 100% 100% 100% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: All 25 CHCO Act agencies have accessed the Employee Viewpoint Survey Online Reporting and Analysis Tool. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

Strategy 6.04: Ensure agencies target, address, and measure key drivers of employee engagement FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM’s MSAC Lead Evaluators met with agency Accountability Program Managers and discussed how agencies could assess the impact of strategies/interventions designed to enhance employee engagement through their independent audit programs. MSAC developed an employee engagement program checklist and interview guides for executives, supervisors, and employees for agencies to use during independent audits. The tools will help the agency gather valuable information for the agency Senior Accountable Official to further assess the impact of activities designed to improve employee engagement. In September 2016, the checklist and interview guides were presented to the Accountability Program Manager Council. During the meeting, MSAC shared how the tools could be used, and the agency Accountability Program Managers were encouraged to incorporate employee engagement during self-assessments. MSAC began incorporating assessment of employee engagement in OPM-led reviews. OPM assessed employee engagement and morale in OPM’s review of the Department of Homeland Security. During Accountability Program Manager Council meetings, MSAC held preliminary discussions on how agency independent audit activity can identify employee engagement “best practices”, which can be shared during future council meetings. MSAC finalized plans to provide formal feedback to agencies on their employee engagement activities when conducting assessments of their evaluation systems using OPM’s Accountability Assessment Tool. 83 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 6.04 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of components of CHCO organizations that increased “leaders lead” scores Refer to Table 6.01A. Strategy 6.05: Partner with agencies to drive greater diversity, inclusion and employee engagement FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM continued to focus on Government-wide diversity and inclusion efforts by issuing the FY 2016 Inclusive Diversity Strategic Plan. The plan identifies three primary goals for agencies to achieve. 1. Diversify the federal workforce through active engagement of leadership. Federal agencies shall foster a diverse, high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of American society. 2. Include and engage everyone in the workplace. Federal agencies shall foster a culture that encourages employees to feel uniquely valued and experience a sense of belonging. 3. Optimize inclusive diversity efforts using data-driven approaches. Federal agencies shall continue to improve their inclusive diversity communication efforts and comply in a timely fashion with Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program requirements. Agency partners across Government are issuing Government-wide Inclusive Diversity Strategic Plans that identify strategies and specific actions to achieve the inclusive diversity goals. OPM provided access and canned reporting capability through USA Staffing® for agencies to evaluate applicant flow data, to support efforts to recruit from all segments of American society. Federal managers use this data analysis to improve outreach and recruitment activities to help fill staff vacancies. OPM continues to work in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on the Diversity and Inclusion in Government Council. The Council formed three workgroups to tackle several challenges, including providing more unconscious/implicit bias training, and resolving challenging sexual orientation/gender identity issues in the workplace. The Council issued policy guidance to all heads of executive departments and agencies on responding to incidents of societal tension and unrest. OPM convened a Diversity and Inclusion Collaboration and Innovation Summit to educate diversity and inclusion, human capital, and equal employment opportunity professionals across Government on ways to collaborate and innovate to make progress toward improving the recruitment, development, and engagement of a diverse Federal workforce. In FY 2016, the Government-wide New IQ score increased to 58 percent from 57 percent. The New IQ is a measure of employee satisfaction with 20 questions from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (EVS). The EVS questions and New IQ measure is broken down into five key habits of Inclusion: Fair, Open, Cooperative, Supportive, and Empowering. The biggest increases among the five habits of inclusion were Fair and Cooperative, both increasing two percentage points. Open and Empowering both increased one percentage point, whereas, Supportive remained unchanged since FY 2015. All New IQ scores are at or above the results from FY 2013. OPM has provided New IQ technical assistance training to more than 10,000 Federal managers and employees since FY 2013. During FY 2016, OPM conducted feedback assistance roundtables whereby OPM diversity and inclusion professionals met with Chief Human Capital Officers, Equal Employment Opportunity, and Diversity and Inclusion Officers from twelve Federal agencies to discuss diversity and inclusion outcomes, including New IQ scores, Hispanic representation, and the employment of people with disabilities. OPM continued to collaborate with agencies to attract applicants and retain employees 84 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Reportfrom historically underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities, at all levels of Government, resulting in some key successes. Executive Order 13548 committed the Executive Branch to enhancing opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the Federal workforce and included a goal to hire 100,000 people with disabilities into Federal service over five years. In FY 2016, OPM announced that in FYs 2011-2015, during which Federal agencies have been implementing Executive Order 13548, the Federal Government hired 109,575 part-time career and full-time career employees with disabilities. By the end of FY 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, total non-seasonal full-time career Federal employment for people with disabilities had increased from 247,608 in FY 2014 to 264,844, representing an increase from 13.56 percent, to 14.41 percent. This is more people with disabilities in Federal service both in real terms and by percentage than at any time in the past 35 years. New hires with disabilities also increased from 20,618 in FY 2014 to 26,466 in FY 2015, representing an increase of 5,851 more hires, or 19.02 percent. As of the end of FY 2015, there were more people with targeted disabilities in Federal service than at any time in the past 19 years. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has determined that performance toward this strategy is making noteworthy progress.

The webcasts included Insurance Updates, D.C. Government Service, Special Retirement Provisions for Law Enforcement and Firefighters, Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality, and Special Benefits Provisions for Senior Officials and Congressional Employees. OPM delivered eight webinars in FY 2016 that received more than 4,000 views. As webcasts are hosted online, they continue to provide training to benefits officers on key topics related to retirement. The webinars are available at: https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/training/ . OPM also provided Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act training in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, GA; Bethesda, MD; Topeka, KS; and Stennis Space Center, MS. In FY 2016, budget constraints across the Federal Government resulted in OPM’s cancellation of its annual Agency Benefit Officers’ T raining conference. To continue to meet benefits officers’ mandatory training needs, OPM delivered virtual benefits officers training seminars. Through the Benefits Officers Virtual T raining Seminar, held in November 2015, OPM provided updates to participants on benefits initiatives, shared best practices, and discussed crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. The event also featured information on OPM’s Retirement Audit initiative and how to provide a healthy retirement case to OPM. The agency provided an additional virtual Federal benefits seminar in June 2016 that integrated feedback from the November event. The seminar focused on increasing knowledge of the Federal benefits programs and improvements to the retirement process. More than 585 people registered for the June seminar, an increase from the more than 440 registrations for the November seminar. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has determined that performance toward this strategy is making noteworthy progress.

Strategy 7.03: Advance the 21st century customer-focused retirement processing system for claims adjudication in a timely and accurate manner FY 2016 Progress Update OPM continues to implement the core components in the Retirement Services (RS) Strategic Plan, including delivering quality customer service to people; implementing productivity and process improvements; partnering with agencies; and making partial, progressive information technology improvements. When the Retirement Services Strategic Plan was released in January 2012, the inventory was 61,108 claims. As of the end of FY 2016, the inventory has been reduced to 15,146. OPM is focused on both its internal process improvements and external outreach towards other Federal agencies to meet its goal of processing 90 percent of claims within 60 days. Based on a Lean Six Sigma process improvement review, OPM has streamlined and standardized workflows. For example, OPM changed processes to review and assemble complete cases before distributing them to legal administrative specialists for adjudication. As of the end of FY 2016, all pending processing claims were processed within an average of 54.1 days, with 77 percent processed within 60 days. In FY 2016, OPM partnered with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and the United States Postal Service (USPS) to help with claims processing during the annual retirement surge. This partnership provided vital help to the agency’s claims processing efforts. The DFAS and USPS employees assisted OPM with getting manual interim pay to annuitants more quickly. A portion of OPM’s workload also involves retirement benefits provided by other agencies that need to be coordinated with OPM’s benefits, such as Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) disability benefits and Office of Worker’s Compensation Programs claims. For instance, the agency receives information from Social Security regularly for its FERS claims processing, and is discussing other process improvements. OPM also meets with both USPS and the National Personnel Records Center on a bi-weekly basis to discuss common issues attendant to retirement processing. The agency anticipates that using 89 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report this internal and external process improvement approach will help OPM meet the 60-day goal. OPM continues to make progress on the five major IT initiatives that will ultimately lead to the realization of its IT strategic vision, including the Electronic Retirement Record, Retirement Data Repository, Data Bridge, Online Retirement Application, and Enterprise Case Management System (ECMS). OPM awarded blanket purchase agreements to five vendors to configure the ECMS Product and also awarded the blanket purchase agreement call for Retirement Services technical requirements development. This will enable OPM to complete the development and documentation of the RS ECMS technical requirements that will be a part of a request for quotes for the RS ECMS configuration. OPM is also working to expand access to the Retirement Data Repository, via Data Viewer, to additional agencies. In FY 2016, OPM continued to add user access to the Data Viewer by working with agencies and payroll providers. At the end of FY 2016, OPM had approximately 600 users and more than 30 agencies using the Data Viewer. These agencies primarily represent the executive branch customers of Defense Finance and Accounting Service and Interior Business Center. OPM has also developed the web service to call Electronic Retirement Record data from the Retirement Data Repository. In addition, the developed Data Gateway will analyze Electronic Retirement Record data and build business rules to transform and map ERR data to the retirement calculator (the Federal Annuity Claims Expert Systems). While OPM anticipates that the implementation of all of the components of its IT strategic vision will impact business operations, the agency cannot determine the impact of each individual system at this time. In FY 2016, OPM actively encouraged individuals to take advantage of resources available through Services Online, a web platform that provides retirement services on demand (https://www.servicesonline.opm.gov/ ). With 599,505 unique users during FY 2016, OPM surpassed the 513,540 unique users in FY 2015, with 71 percent repeat users. OPM continues to make improvements to Services Online to enhance the customer experience to encourage both new users and repeat customers. OPM has relied on customer feedback, forward focused initiatives, and process improvements to address customer needs. In FY 2016, OPM completed the relocation of the Boyers Retirement Information Office to Butler, PA and implemented a new phone system which utilizes VoIP technology. Both initiatives will improve OPM’s ability to meet customer inquiries. OPM has also added additional call center phone lines to allow for more callers and reduce busy signals. Due to reduced call center staff, OPM has seen an increase in wait times and higher abandonment rates. In the final quarter of FY 2016, OPM hired an additional 38 customer service specialists in the Retirement Information Office to address the high call demand. A challenging component to implementing this strategy is the unexpected surge in retirement applications. When agencies make Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and Voluntary Separation Incentive Program offers, OPM may see a significant increase in retirement applications. OPM works closely with agencies to understand upcoming retirement offers. However, surges in retirement applications can occur outside of OPM’s control and predictions. OPM also tries to anticipate legislative challenges that may impact the strategy. For example, this may include a change in how retirement annuities are calculated (similar to the White House’s initiative on advanced sick leave). OPM, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement. 90 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 7 .03A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Average unit cost (direct labor only) for processing retirement claims FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend $101.89 $91.37 $129.83 $124.48 $127. 8 6 ≤$128.47 Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM calculated the average unit cost based on 202,622 claims processed in FY 2016. This includes annuitant, survivor, and refund and deposit claims. The agency reduced the retirement claims inventory to a steady state by implementing core strategies within the Retirement Services Strategic plan, such as hiring and maintaining staff, implementing process improvements, partnering with agencies, and improving information technology. As part of this effort, OPM manages workload through reporting structures that classify the claims into “buckets” of work. Identifying problem areas and bottlenecks helped OPM develop optimal solutions. Also, consistent with resource constraints in FY 2016, Retirement Services labor costs for claims processing decreased, which decreased the overall cost for claims processing. While OPM relies on direct labor costs to calculate results for this measure, additional costs are incurred when processing claims.

OPM projected that it accurately processed 123,298 of an estimated 129,020 retirement and survivor claims. OPM has implemented strategies and techniques to support the continued improvement of claims accuracy. The strategies include standardized and improved training for legal administrative specialists, roundtable discussions to create consistency among reviewers, online training modules, and refresher technical training. Claims adjudicators are also using a checklist, developed as part of a Lean Six Sigma process improvement effort, to assist in the reduction of errors. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase of processing accuracy. 91 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 7 .03C PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of retirement claims processed within 60 days FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A* 79% 70.1% 7 7.1% ≥90% Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM processed 72,913 of 94,545 claims within 60 days, an increase of more than seven percentage points from the FY 2015 results. As stated in the Strategy 7.03 Progress Update, OPM partnered with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and the United States Postal Service (USPS) to help with claims processing during the annual retirement surge. This partnership provided vital help to the agency’s claims processing efforts. The DFAS and USPS employees assisted with getting out manual interim pay to annuitants faster. The 77.1 percent of cases OPM processed in less than 60 days were processed in an average of 45 days, while the remainder was processed in an average of 100 days. For those cases taking an average of 102 days, the primary reason was OPM required additional information from the new annuitant, their former agency, or both. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

The response rate was 24 percent. Of the 227 respondents who answered the question, 164 reported that they were satisfied. OPM continued to support excellent customer service in FY 2016 through the Retirement Services (RS) CARE Campaign. The acronym CARE communicates the four key values that RS employees should demonstrate: Compassion, Accuracy, Responsiveness, and Empowerment. The CARE team uses the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to identify areas of success and challenges, and communicates the results throughout RS and develops an action plan to address concerns. The team also collects feedback from RS employees on customer satisfaction improvements, which it uses as a resource for future planning. The CARE initiative has helped RS provide enhanced customer service to annuitants, survivors, and family members. In FY 2016, OPM encouraged individuals to take advantage of the resources available through Services Online, a web platform that provides retirement services on demand (https://www.servicesonline.opm.gov/). OPM conducted a deeper dive into customer service feedback with annuitants from the FY 2015 survey who volunteered to be interviewed about their experience. Interview results provided OPM with insights into areas that may require additional attention. OPM plans on continuing the process of in-depth interviews in the future. OPM Retirement Services’ Retirement Information Office experienced substantial staffing challenges in FY 2016. In addition, the overflow call services contract ended in July 2016, resulting in a loss of approximately 20 trained contract staff. To address these challenges, OPM hired 38 Customer Service Specialists at the end of FY 2016. While the new staff will not immediately be able to fully participate in call handling, given an estimated a three to four month training time, OPM expects the new staff to enhance the agency’s ability to respond to customer service inquiries. Interacting with customers through the Retirement Information Office is an important component of OPM’s customer service efforts. Also in FY 2016, OPM implemented a new phone system, which uses VoIP technology to enhance customer care. During the phone testing phase, however, OPM’s ability to handle calls was affected, resulting in a decreased the call handling rate. OPM has completed the testing phase and this issue has been resolved. 92 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 7 .03E PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Rate of improper payments in the retirement program FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend .36% .36% .38% .38% .37% ≤.37% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: Of more than $82 billion in payments, $304 million, or .37 percent, were improper. In FY 2016, OPM’s overpayment rate was .29 percent and the underpayment rate was .08 percent. OPM continues to make progress in efforts to reduce the extent and rate of improper payments and to recover an increasing percentage of improper payments. OPM’s Retirement Services Quality Assurance Office performs continuous audits of newly adjudicated retiree and survivor claims to calculate processing accuracy rates and the corresponding value of improper payments, as well as to identify any training or systemic deficiencies. The information gained through these audits is used to make informed decisions regarding resources and to ensure compliance with policies and procedures governing the determination and payment of benefits. OPM’s Annuity Roll is also checked weekly by Retirement Services against the Social Security Administration’s death record and annually against the full Social Security Administration Death Master File to identify deceased annuitants. In FY 2016, OPM developed an information exchange agreement with the Social Security Administration (SSA) where OPM will provide data on reported deaths from the annuity roll to SSA. This in turn will also assist SSA in identifying and remediating improper payments. OPM also receives information of deaths or potential disability fraud from outside individuals (for example, family, friends, or co-workers) and investigates these reports using online public databases and by requesting medical records. Additionally, OPM’s Office of Inspector General uses a variety of approaches to identify potential cases for further investigation, including proactive reviews of online records to verify annuitant pay. Retirement Services routinely refers potential cases to the Office of the Inspector General for further review and the two offices work collaboratively to address program vulnerabilities. OPM also has staff dedicated to generate, review and take action on numerous data pulls to maintain and promote the integrity of the Annuity Roll. The agency is continuously on the lookout for other opportunities to detect anomalies or other indicators in its data that may require further analysis through an ad hoc query. OPM uses data mining to show, for example, cases where payments to more than one payee are out of balance, where amounts of benefits exceed a threshold, and when multiple payments are returned. OPM also trains and provides guidance to agency benefits officers to ensure that employees understand all of the benefit options available to them. A highly trained cadre of human resource benefits officers assists OPM by producing fully developed retirement cases with accurate information, leading to fewer errors or omissions and thus fewer improper payments. By continuously monitoring payments and taking corrective actions when warranted, OPM believes it can reduce its rate of improper payments. Although OPM’s overall improper payments rate for the Retirement program continues to be low considering its size and complexity, OPM will continue working towards reducing retirement related improper payments in FY 2017 and beyond. 93 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 7 .03F PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of retirement program customer calls handled FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 81% 82% 76% 72% 66.8% ≥78% Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: In FY 2016, OPM handled 1,059,998 of 1,585,909 calls.

The agency identified several challenges and has implemented plans to enhance OPM’s ability to increase the percentage of calls handled. OPM Retirement Services’ Retirement Information Office experienced substantial staffing challenges in FY 2016. In addition, an overflow call services contract ended in July 2016, resulting in a loss of approximately 20 trained contract staff. To address these challenges, OPM hired 38 customer service specialists at the end of FY 2016. The new staff will have a lag time to fully participate in call handling, and OPM estimates a three to four month time period to allow for training. Despite the lag, OPM expects the new staff to enhance the agency’s ability to respond to customer service inquiries. In FY 2016, OPM implemented a new phone system that uses VoIP technology to enhance customer care. However, the phone testing phase impacted the agency’s ability to handle calls and thus decreased the call handling rate. The testing phase has been completed and this issue has been resolved. 94 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportAGENCY PRIORITY GOAL: RETIREMENT SERVICES CASE PROCESSING Goal Statement: Reduce Federal retirement case processing time by making comprehensive improvements and moving toward electronic processing of all retirement applications. In FY 2016, process 90 percent of cases in 60 days or less (as of March 2015, 70.1 percent of cases were processed in 60 days or less). Support the 90/60 goal by: • increasing the percentage of complete cases received from agencies to 90 percent or greater; • continuing to develop capabilities to receive electronic retirement applications; and • building a court-ordered benefit case reporting mechanism to capture inventory and timeliness of court-ordered cases by the first quarter of FY 2016. Establish baseline data for timeliness by the end of FY 2016. FY 2016 Progress Update • OPM’s claims processing accuracy rate was 95.6 percent for FY 2016, using a weighted average (FY 2016 target is 95 percent). • In FY 2016, an average of 89.2 percent of retirement applications submissions that OPM received were considered complete. Data is posted on the OPM website: http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/strategic-plans/agency-audit-monthly-update.pdf . • OPM also processed 77 percent of pending claims within 60 days (target is 90 percent). The overall average processing time for retirement claims was 54.1 days, with an average of 45 days for claims processed in 60 days or less and 100 days for claims processed in more than 60 days.• OPM continued to expand access for agency human resources and payroll offices to the Retirement Data Repository via Data Viewer. The Data Viewer enhances productivity and reduces errors by aggregating information from multiple systems and enabling users to see retirement-related data submitted via data feeds and imaged documents based on the users’ defined roles and responsibilities in the system. OPM continued to add increased user access to the Data Viewer by working with agencies and payroll providers. At the end of September 2016, approximately 600 users and over 30 agencies were using the Data Viewer. These agencies primarily represent the executive branch customers of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Interior Business Center. • Retirement Services conducted two Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) workshops in early August, at OPM headquarters in D.C. The target audience for the workshops was benefits or staffing human resource specialists who work with retirement coverage determinations or issues. The first day of the workshops included a review of the basic retirement coverage rules and the steps required to process an error decision. Day two of the workshops guided attendees through the process of putting together a complete decision package for employees who need to make a FERCCA election as well as the correction process once the employee makes an election. 95 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report • OPM hosted a webcast on Special Benefits Provisions for Senior Officials and Congressional employees. The webcast included topics such as background information and service credit deposits, with the main focus on the special elections that senior officials are entitled to when they became subject to Social Security coverage. The target audience for the website was benefits officers, individuals who fall in the staff categories, and staffing human resource specialists who work with retirement coverage determinations or issues. • OPM also hosted a webcast on FERS Revised Annuity Employee (RAE) and FERS Further Revised Annuity Employee (FRAE). The webcast included background information and coverage determinations. The target audience for the webcast was benefits officers, individuals who are covered under these benefits, and staffing human resource specialists who work with retirement coverage determinations or issues. • OPM placed a system for tracking court ordered benefits into production in June 2016. The agency loaded data from the previous system into the new system and is currently doing data cleanup, which is necessary to ensure accurate reporting of processing times and workload. OPM has mapped out the workflows for measuring processing times and will be now testing those workflows with real data. The agency completed training for users by October 2016. OPM will continue to focus on improving retirement claims processing, and has set a new retirement services case processing Agency Priority Goal for 2016-2017.

The FY 2016 target was an ambitious goal established to continue OPM’s upward trend for this measure. The most recent results show an increase of 1.5 percentage points when compared with the FY 2015 results, and 5.2 percentage points when compared with the FY 2014 results. 96 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportSTRATEGIC GOAL 8: ENHANCE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE Strategy 8.01: Enhance policy, procedures and processes used to ensure people are fit to serve FY 2016 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement for three consecutive fiscal years. In FY 2016, OPM continued to focus its efforts on maintaining its high quality standards and meeting the timeliness standards established in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and by the Director of National Intelligence. With respect to background investigation quality, in FY 2016, OPM met its goal–99 percent or more of all investigations were determined to be quality complete. OPM consistently met this goal in FY 2014 and FY 2015. Since September 2014, when OPM announced it would not exercise options to renew contracts with the contractor that performed the majority of OPM’s background investigations, the agency has been unable to meet investigation timeliness standards. OPM met its timeliness goals in FY 2014, but failed to meet its timeliness goals in FY 2015 and FY 2016. The average number of days to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security investigations increased from 35 to 67 to 123 days in FY 2014, FY 2015, and FY 2016 respectively. The target is 40 days. The average number of days to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial Secret national security investigations increased from 30 to 58 to 108 days in FY 2014, FY 2015, and FY 2016 respectively. The target is 40 days. And the average number of days to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial Top Secret national security investigations increased from 75 to 147 to 220 days in FY 2014, FY 2015, and FY 2016 respectively. The target is 80 days. In January 2016, OPM hosted a structured stakeholder engagement to discuss the current state of the investigation program and improvement plans. The improvement plan included hiring 400 additional Federal investigators by the end of FY 2016. Beginning in the second quarter of FY 2017, OPM began the process to hire 200 additional Federal investigators. OPM extended offers to 400 qualified candidates and brought 363 federal investigators onboard in FY 2016. OPM brought onboard an additional 34 investigators in October 2016. In addition, in September 2016, OPM awarded investigative fieldwork services contracts to two additional contractors, increasing the number of fieldwork contractors from two to four, and further expanding its investigative capacity in FY 2017. The new field contract is expected to begin in February 2017. Also in January 2016, OPM announced a decision to create a new Federal entity, the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), to provide a more secure and effective Federal background investigations infrastructure. This followed a 90-day Suitability and Security review conducted by the interagency Suitability and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council in FY 2015 in light of recent cybersecurity threats, including a well-publicized breach of information housed at OPM. This review re-examined reforms to the Federal background investigations process, assessed additional enhancements to further secure information networks and systems, and determined improvements that could be made to the way the Government conducts background investigations for suitability, national security, and credentialing. In March 2016, OPM announced the formation of a team to develop and implement a plan for establishing the NBIB. On October 1, 2016, the NBIB began operation with the mission to deliver efficient and effective background investigations to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of the Federal workforce. The NBIB absorbed the Federal Investigative Services’ mission, workload, and personnel, without interruption to ongoing investigative case processing. In October 2015, OPM implemented, in accordance with the timelines established in a Government-wide implementation plan, Tier 3 and Tier 3 Reinvestigations of the Federal 97 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Investigative Standards that OPM and the Director of National Intelligence jointly issued in December 2012. In addition, throughout FY 2016, OPM developed the Tier 4 and Tier 4 Reinvestigation, and Tier 5 and Tier 5 Reinvestigation products for implementation on October 1, 2016. OPM provided information about the new investigation products in Federal Investigation Notices 16-02 and 16-07 dated October 6, 2015, and September 26, 2016, respectively. On October 2, 2015, OPM published FY 2016 investigation pricing rates. The new prices were designed to fully recover a 7.8 percent increase in the costs necessary to run the investigations program. Primary cost drivers were acquisition of additional investigative resources to address the imbalance between existing capacity and workload, and information technology security and system enhancements to protect against cyber-attacks and make the investigative process more efficient. On September 21, 2016, OPM published FY 2017 investigation billing rates to fully recover an estimated 5.4 percent increase in the costs necessary to sustain and advance the investigation program. The primary cost drivers were the newly re-competed investigative contracts, capacity growth, and alignment initiatives aimed to reduce the backlog and improve and align investigative resources in critical high-workload locations, as well as the establishment of the NBIB. In FY 2016, OPM continued to work with the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and other agencies to implement Government-wide quality standards. The standards were approved by the Security and Suitability Executive Agents in January 2015 to facilitate the measurement and continued improvement of investigative quality across the executive branch. The new automated Quality Assessment Rating Tool will be available in FY 2017 to document agency quality assessments. The NBIB performance improvement plan includes increasing capacity by hiring additional 200 federal field investigators in FY 2017 and awarding contracts to two additional fieldwork contractors. In addition, the NBIB continues to streamline processes through its business process reengineering efforts. AGENCY PRIORITY GOAL: BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS CASE PROCESSING TIMELINESS AND QUALITY Goal Statement: Increase investigative capacity and implement additional process improvements with the aim of meeting the timeliness standards set by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 for background investigations while maintaining investigative quality. Throughout FY 2017, OPM will improve production output in response to the increasing workload demands of its customers, while reducing the larger than normal inventory of cases created during the transition from one of its investigative contractors. OPM will accomplish this while maintaining its target of 99 percent or more of all OPM investigations adjudicated as “quality complete” for investigations closed. 98 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportFY 2016 Progress Update • On October 1, 2015, OPM implemented the Tier 3 and the Tier 3 Reinvestigation products. The new products are based on the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards. OPM will assess the impact of the Tier 3 and the Tier 3 Reinvestigation products on timeliness in FY 2017. • On October 1, 2016, OPM launched the Tiers 4 and 5 investigation products for high risk and top secret clearance determinations. • In October 2015, OPM published a Federal Investigations Notice announcing its products and service pricing for FY 2016. • Beginning in the second quarter of FY 2016, OPM began the process to hire 400 additional Federal investigators. In FY 2016, OPM made 400 conditional offers of employment to Federal field investigators, brought 363 onboard, and brought the remaining 37 onboard by the end of CY 2016.• To counter the impact of the non-renewal of an investigative fieldwork contract with a major FIS contractor in FY 2014, OPM continued to work with its two remaining investigative fieldwork contractors to increase their production. In addition, in September 2016, OPM solicited new proposals for a fieldwork contract and awarded contracts to two additional investigative fieldwork contractors, further expanding its investigation capacity. • Actions taken to expand investigative capacity were within budget constraints, and maintained the current high quality of OPM’s investigations. OPM will continue to focus on improving background investigation timeliness and quality, and has set a new investigation services case processing Agency Priority Goal for 2016-2017.

While the agency works to improve timeliness and reduce its inventory, OPM continued to focus on the quality of its investigations. OPM uses a multi-level quality review process that includes quality check points throughout the investigation process and a final quality review performed by OPM’s Federal employees before the investigations are sent to the agencies. OPM has various methods for collecting feedback from agencies, including an online quality assessment tool, reopen requests, and a quality hotline. In FY 2016, OPM worked with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Defense to develop a Quality Assessment Rating Tool to be launched in FY 2017. The feedback collected is used to evaluate policies and procedures, and enhance employee training and resources. 99 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 8.01B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Average number of days to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security investigations FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 36 35 35 67 123 ≤40 Not Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM completed 346,825 initial national security investigations in FY 2016.

OPM increased its focus on agencies determined to have less-than-effective accountability systems and on known problem areas, such as competitive examining or improper use of certain appointing authorities. The agency recently revised OPM’s approach to reporting so agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs), Deputy CHCOs, and HR Directors would become more aware of critical human capital deficiencies. The revised approach also provided suggestions for making good human capital framework systems and procedures more impactful and efficient. OPM’s human capital evaluations allow for in-depth analysis of agencies’ strengths and weaknesses across a broad spectrum of human capital areas, including strategic planning and accountability efforts. The agency has developed a modernized approach to identifying which agencies will benefit most from these strategic reviews. In addition, OPM’s interviews and focus-groups with frontline employees, supervisors, and managers have provided a unique source of information to agencies on how programs and efforts to improve human capital management, including employee engagement, are actually working. OPM’s comprehensive review of one agency revealed a pervasive misuse of time-limited appointing authorities. In addition to finding multiple regulatory violations throughout the agency, OPM’s study revealed that the use of time-limited appointing authorities did not provide quality and timely HR services to managers and did not help the agency meet its mission. OPM’s comprehensive evaluation also identified opportunities for the agency to improve its planning and management of its current HR restructuring initiative. MSAC will continue to work closely with the agency to improve its HR management operations to adhere to Federal requirements and to better support its mission. OPM’s comprehensive review of a second agency included an in-depth review of employee morale and engagement efforts, as well as a programmatic review of performance management and the use of delegated examining authorities. OPM’s results provided insightful observations, including a lack of two-way communication which had a direct impact on employee perceptions. While the agency was striving to improve employee morale and engagement, employees felt they were not being heard. Significantly, performance ratings did not distinguish high performers from others, awards were not seen as meaningful, and efforts to engage were not seen as sincere. Results of OPM’s evaluation linked specifically to three leadership areas where the agency could establish measures for progress using corresponding executive core qualifications. OPM identified successful practices in certain components that could be translated to other parts of the Department. In August 2016, OPM issued a report on its special study of agencies’ use of Pathways Programs authorities. OPM’s findings showed that the Pathways Programs in the agencies generally have adhered to the five core principles to advance merit system principles and the policies established by Executive Order 13562. The findings impact the operations of the student programs in all Federal agencies. OPM’s recommendations included calls for (1) strengthening workforce planning efforts for Pathways, (2) exploring low-cost or cost-neutral outreach activities, (3) arranging recruiting training for agency hiring managers, and (4) continually monitoring Pathways Program usage patterns and gauging program effectiveness through oversight activities. T wo programmatic findings resulted in changes to OPM guidance to agencies and its Toolkit. These changes were related to (1) granting veterans’ preferences to PMF candidates and (2) the appropriate manner to conduct Pathways career fairs to ensure fair and open competition. 102 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 8.02A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of agency human capital or human resources offices evaluated by OPM that demonstrate progress in improving their human capital programs FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* 75% 89% 82.8% 88.5% ≥75% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: Twenty-six offices/installations were in violation of Federal human resource/human capital laws, regulations, or policies and were required to take corrective actions. Twenty-three of those 26 addressed at least 70 percent of their corrective actions within OPM timeframes. OPM’s lead evaluators continuously engaged with agencies’ HR staffs throughout the year, providing more in-depth and timely knowledge of strategic and compliance-based human capital challenges, and more direct access to help agencies take action on the issues OPM identified in its corrective action reports. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

OPM’s continuous engagement with the agencies, assistance with development of action plans, and monitoring of improvement efforts were resource-intensive, but helped ensure agency competitive hiring practices operated effectively and were in full compliance. Strategy 8.03: Provide guidance, tools, and training to help agencies attain human capital management goals and meet OPM requirements FY 2016 Progress Update OPM has developed procedures for certifying personnel responsible for conducting independent audits and evaluations of their agency’s human capital management programs. In collaboration with the Accountability Program Managers Council and the CHCO Council’s skills gaps work group, OPM identified required competencies and procedures governing the nomination process, including pre-requisites and supporting evidence. This is in line with OPM’s commitment to provide agencies with guidance on developing and enhancing their human capital accountability programs, and is a complement to the CHCO Council community efforts to professionalize the HR workforce through training and certification. OPM also has developed a prototype for a formal credentialing program for delegated examining that includes a more comprehensive set of training prerequisites, required on-the-job activities, a pass/fail assessment component, and a more rigorous re-certification process. One fourth of the Federal workforce is hired under delegated examining procedures, which are governed by complex laws and regulations. OPM’s training program and proposed enhanced certification process will help ensure agency HR professionals possess the knowledge and skills required to engage in effective and compliant recruitment and hiring activities. The complexity of the laws and regulations associated with delegated examining contribute to the skills gaps that have been identified in the HR community. The proposed certification program is designed to close those mission-critical skills gaps, to improve competitive examining services Government-wide, and aid in improving the level of hiring manager satisfaction with the quality of new hires. For Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) and evaluator classes, ongoing challenges include turnover among seasoned instructors who can provide training, limited funds for instructor travel, and the need to update training materials tied to the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook to ensure that they are current. 104 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportIn order to meet the changing needs of OPM’s customers within the current landscape, OPM’s Human Resources Solutions (HRS) updated its corporate strategic initiatives after holding strategic planning refresh sessions with each practice area and the HRS senior executive team. The four initiatives that resulted from these sessions represent OPM’s highest HRS-level corporate initiatives for FY 2016-2017. 1. Lead the Federal Government in advancing the field of human capital management. HRS strategically positioned itself and OPM to have an impact on the Federal Government through its Government-wide reach, as well as its product and service offerings. In FY 2016, HRS was a major force for the Federal Government’s Hiring Excellence initiative, launched the Presidential Executive Fellows program, and absorbed the Presidential Management Fellows program. 2. Create and enhance strategic partnerships to deliver human capital solutions. In FY 2016, OPM formed a partnership with GSA to launch the Human Capital and T raining Solutions contract vehicles. This $11.5 billion indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract, awarded in FY 2016, will revolutionize the way human capital and training products are purchased across the Federal Government.3. Lead the Government-wide Human Capital Category Management initiative. HRS possesses unique expertise to determine the best products, services, and providers of cost-effective solutions for Federal agencies’ human capital challenges. In FY 2016, HRS established the Category Management Leadership Council to oversee this category, sought and hired a human capital category manager for the Federal Government, and developed the first human capital category management strategic plan. 4. Automate components of the Business Reference Model to drive best-in-breed Human Resources IT Systems, as a foundation for the USA Suite of Services (USA Hire SM, USA PerformanceSM, USA SurveySM, and USA LearningSM). In FY 2016, HRS launched the General Schedule version of its USA Performance SM performance management tool. It developed the first draft model of what will become USA Suite. Further, it continued to transition current customers to its new USA Staffing® talent acquisition system. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has determined that performance toward this strategy is making noteworthy progress. 105 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 8.03A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Index score of customer satisfaction with quality of delegated examining and evaluator training FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 92 98 90 97. 8 97.9 ≥90 Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: OPM conducted surveys throughout FY 2016, at the end of each of 47 classes.

With 314 respondents, the response rate was 42.3 percent. The survey consists of 20 core questions, 11 demographic and business items, and three American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) questions. Sixty-five percent of respondents were GS-14s or GS-15s and 47 percent of respondents had more than 20 years of Federal service. The response rate for the fall 2016 survey was 50 percent, the highest single response rate since 2007. Sixteen of 20 core items yielded at least 90 percent positive responses. The annualized ACSI score of 80 meets OPM’s FY 2016 target. The scores for individual core questions ranged from 98 percent (Q16: Would you use HR Solutions’ services again?) to 55 percent (Q15: How would you compare our performance to other contractors for similar services?). The greatest swing between two scores was on Q15, which decreased from 67 percent in the spring 2016 survey to 55 percent in the fall. The greatest rise in score was Q13 (How would you rate the value of products or services you have received?), which increased 11 percentage points from 83 percent to 94 percent. 106 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportAGENCY PRIORITY GOAL: HUMAN RESOURCE WORKFORCE CAPABILITY Goal Statement: Improve the ability of the Federal human resource workforce to attract, develop, train, and support talent in the Federal Government by developing and launching a Federal HR curriculum. By the end of FY 2016, build and launch curricula for staffing and classification. Baseline HR professionals’ proficiency levels for the Staffing specialty area competencies, and set targets for improvement. By the end of FY 2017, build and launch curricula for employee relations and labor relations and design a certification of mastery for existing HR University curricula. FY 2016 Progress Update In Q1, OPM developed course titles and content requirements based on internal technical expertise and consultation with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC). The development of these course/titles and requirements is consistent with OPM’s university-like approach for the HR curriculum, which includes foundational (community college), specialties (undergraduate), and world class strategy (graduate). In Q2, OPM worked to identify a vendor with the technical expertise required to build courses based on learning requirements. Meanwhile, OPM partnered with the CHCOC to identify additional resources Federal HR specialists will need to supplement the curriculum. Examples include: • a competency assessment to identify skills gaps and development needs; • developmental detail programs that will enable HR specialists to pursue experiential learning to develop competencies; and • certification of mastery as a micro-credentialing strategy that can develop support for certification as a formal requirement for advancement in the Federal HR profession. OPM also continued its initiative to validate technical competencies for the classification technical specialty area, as a precursor for eventual development of classification courses. Finally, OPM launched planning for the 2016 HR Virtual Conference, which will focus thematically on staffing in support of the Hiring Excellence Campaign and the HRU curriculum build-out. In Q3, OPM assembled an integrated program team to redesign the Delegated Examining (DE) Certification Program to include a more robust and comprehensive assessment process. The integrated program team developed a draft framework and presented it to the CHCOC members in May 2016, and received concurrence to continue the effort. The framework will include a formal assessment, as well as proof of mastery through demonstrated experience, so that HR staffing professionals are knowledgeable and capable to perform delegated examining successfully and in accordance with law and regulation. Also in Q3, OPM awarded a contract for the development of the HR curriculum. The selected contractor began work on developing the objectives and curriculum recommendations for the staffing component of the curriculum. These recommendations and subsequent HR staffing courses will map to OPM learning requirements as well as to needs articulated by the CHCOC. OPM also (1) began planning for the curriculum rollout to take place in Q4, (2) worked with the CHCOC to formulate a strategy for assessing HR competencies in order to help agencies and HR specialists target their developmental investments and activities, (3) continued validating technical competencies for the classification technical specialty area, and (4) continued planning the HR Virtual Conference. 107 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report In Q4 of FY 2016, OPM presented the draft objectives and curriculum recommendations for the staffing specialists and a Delegated Examining certification prototype to the CHCOC’s Executive Steering Committee for HR Skills Gap for acceptance. OPM also held an HR Virtual Conference to launch HRU staffing courses as part of the Hiring Excellence Initiative. OPM validated technical competencies for classification, which will be used to inform the classification curriculum.Also in Q4, the HR Closing Skills Gaps Federal Agency Skill Team and the Workforce Data Analytics Strategy group completed a root cause analysis for the Federal HR Specialist. This data will be used to inform OPM’s planning efforts in FY 2017 and beyond.

OPM is continuing to partner with the CHCO Council Executive Steering Committee to implement the new HR course curriculum. This includes defining whether HRU will be used as the vehicle to support registration and course completion for the new curriculum. Final decisions have not yet been made regarding how, or whether, HRU will have a continued role in the delivery of the curriculum, and OPM has deferred most of its activities related to HRU, including promotional activities that the agency previously engaged in to drive HR specialists to the site. As a result, the target was not met this quarter, but once final decisions are made, OPM will determine how to proceed. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. FY 2016 MilestoneMet/ Not Met Cover 100 percent of staffing and classification learning requirements by HRU courses and resources Met 108 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportStrategy 8.04: Assure effective human capital management of Senior Executive Service (SES) and other senior employees FY 2016 Progress Update In October 2015, OPM announced the revised Senior Executive Service (SES) performance appraisal system certification process, which was available to agencies that have adopted the basic SES performance appraisal system. Since the design of the basic SES system meets all certification criteria, OPM must only review the implementation and application of the system, reducing the amount of documentation that agencies are required to submit to OPM for certification. This decrease in required documentation has decreased the time required to review the documentation. The revised SES performance appraisal system certification process was developed by an interagency working group made up of a diverse group of agency subject matter experts, and allows greater opportunity for agencies to partner with OPM and share responsibility for reviewing certification criteria.Also, in August 2016, OPM announced the design and issuance of a standard Senior-Level (SL) and Scientific and Professional (ST) performance appraisal system and program available for voluntary agency adoption. A working group of agency subject matter experts developed the system/program. Much like the basic SES performance appraisal system, the design of the basic SL/ST system/program demonstrates compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for system approval and certification, and those agencies that adopt the system qualify for the streamlined certification process originally introduced for SES certification in October 2015. OPM expanded USA Performance system users (SES only) from four agencies to six agencies in FY 2016. An additional five agencies signed agreements to start using the system in FY 2017 for both their SES, SL/ST, and GS employees. In August, OPM’s USA Performance fielded a major release (2.0) that expanded the functionality of the system to all pay plans. OPM also deployed two releases, which enhanced functionality for the SES, and hosted a joint requirement gathering session with representatives from 10 or more agencies for SL/ST system requirements.

Customers have consistently given high marks for satisfaction with the system and the service surrounding the system. USA Performance completed its second complete performance cycle with customer agencies, and the system has expanded to include other pay plans. OPM enhanced the system in FY 2016 to increase the ease of use and streamline the paper-intensive process. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. STRATEGIC GOAL 9: PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH BENEFITS AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, FEDERAL RETIREES, THEIR FAMILIES, AND POPULATIONS NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR OPM-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS Strategy 9.01: Sponsor high quality, affordable insurance products FY 2016 Progress Update OPM administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, which provides a comprehensive package of health benefits for more than 8.2 million employees, retirees, tribal employees, and their family members. In order to help provide sufficient information for enrollees to make health plan decisions, OPM provides plan brochures, web-based decision tools, and customer satisfaction survey results to enrollees. OPM developed a revised and enhanced plan comparison tool for use during Open Season 2016. Further, OPM aims to provide enrollees a variety of plan choices. For the 2016 plan year, enrollees had 252 health plan choices. In 2016, OPM approved 245 health plan choices for the 2017 plan year. One of OPM’s roles as administrator of the FEHB is to provide guidance to Federal agencies, Shared Service Centers, and payroll providers to facilitate their compliance with the Employer Shared Responsibility provisions under Sections 6056 and 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code. To assist Federal agencies in their administration of these provisions, OPM has provided guidance on its website. In calendar year (CY) 2016, applicable large employers, including the Federal 110 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Reportgovernment, were required to provide statements to their full-time employees about the health coverage they offered by March 31, and to the IRS by June 30. During FY 2016, agencies met or exceeded all Employer Shared Responsibility reporting deadlines for CY 2016. In FY 2016, OPM awarded a new contract to a new provider for the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS). FSAFEDS conducted an Open Season in FY 2017 and more than 415,000 participants enrolled, an increase of nearly 15 percent from last year’s Open Season. Most of that increase came from the addition of the US Postal Service, which joined FSAFEDS for 2017. In FY 2016, OPM awarded a new contract for the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) to its prior carrier. OPM held an enrollee decision period to offer Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program enrollees the opportunity to mitigate premium increases by restructuring benefits (lower daily value, shorter duration, or both).The Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Program held an Open Enrollment period at the end of FY 2016. This Open Enrollment period was the first one since 2004. OPM is also responsible for implementing and overseeing the Multi-State Plan Program, as required by the Affordable Care Act. For the 2016 plan year, OPM contracted with two Multi-State Plan Program issuers to offer more than 260 plans in 32 states, and the District of Columbia. Program options included both individual plans and Small Business Health Options Program plans. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has determined that performance towards this strategy is making noteworthy progress. TABLE 9.01A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Number of people enrolled in the Multi-State Plan Program FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* N/A*351,437 (Estimate)473,700 (Estimate)378,700 ≥500,000 Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: Due to the volatility of the individual health insurance market, there has been contraction in the number of issuers participating on the Exchanges overall. This trend has extended to the Program, with fewer plan options and, therefore, lower enrollment during FY 2016. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 111 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 9.01B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Number of tribes, tribal organizations or urban Indian organizations participating in FEHB FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* 48 61 85 90 ≥84 Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: The Tribal Desk received the Director’s Award for Excellence in Support of OPM’s Commitment to Customer Service as well as a 2016 President’s Customer Service Award. The tribal program has grown successfully for several reasons. The FEHB benefit packages meet the tribes’ needs at a competitive price. In addition, OPM continues to promote FEHB through outreach activities, including attending tribe conferences and hosting training events to familiarize potential tribes with the FEHB. These factors resulted in a high satisfaction level, and new tribes are hearing about the program from other satisfied tribes and contacting the Tribal Desk to learn more about the FEHB Program. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

In FY 2016, the percent of satisfied FEHBP enrollees exceeded the industry trend by more than 10 percentage points. There was a break in trend between FY 2014 and FY 2015 because Medicare patients were excluded from the sample beginning in FY 2015 to conform to standardized sampling rules for commercial plans. In addition, the Federal Annuitant Benefits Survey was developed and implemented as an annuitant feedback mechanism after the Medicare population was removed from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems sample in 2015. The survey includes questions about health plan experience, prescription drug coverage, Federal Employees Health Benefits health plan ratings (importance, adequacy and value), and basic demographics. The survey also includes questions about annuitant health and wellness and tobacco use in order to understand the retiree population’s health demographics. To maximize accessibility to the annuitant population, the survey was administered via an “open participation” link posted in various locations on OPM’s website. This method of administration ensured that participation was not limited to only annuitants who provided an email address to OPM. (If the survey had been administered to a sample of annuitants, the sample would have been pulled using registered e-mail addresses). The survey was available to participants from October 24, 2016 through December 2, 2016, and results are expected in spring 2017. Strategy 9.02: Optimize insurance related business processes FY 2016 Progress Update OPM utilizes the annual Call Letter to FEHB carriers to emphasize certain initiatives. In FY 2016, the annual Call Letter for 2017 plans emphasized limiting cost growth, managing prescription drugs, supporting access to care, coordinating benefits for the Medicare population, implementing the Plan Performance Assessment, and continuing to implement Self Plus One coverage. The FY 2016 Carrier Conference, which had approximately 400 attendees, reinforced the priorities of the Call Letter. During FY 2016, OPM implemented the FEHB Health Plan Performance Assessment system to measure and reward FEHB plan performance through the use of common, objective, and quantifiable performance measures. The performance assessment framework uses 19 measures to assess key aspects of clinical quality, customer service, and resource use performance, as well as a separate evaluation of contract oversight. The Performance Assessment is linked to health plan profit, with the Overall Performance Score impacting the Service Charge or Performance Adjustment. In response to carrier feedback, OPM created the FEHB Performance Assessment Best Practices Workgroup to help carriers identify and share best practices. In FY 2016, OPM kicked off the workgroup and held sessions in March, June, and August. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the FEHB statute to provide for a Self Plus One enrollment type in addition to the Self Only and Self and Family types available at that time. In CY 2016, Self Plus One was available for the first time. As of March 2016, there were 542,297 Self Plus One enrollments. 113 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report One of OPM’s challenges in administering the FEHB is to contain premium increases while maintaining essential health benefits. OPM engages in annual negotiations with health carriers and has been able to limit average FEHB premium increases to 6.5 percent or less for five consecutive years. OPM established a Multi-State Plan Advisory Board that provides feedback and insight into the development and implementation of the Multi-State Plan Program. The group met in March 2016 to discuss state plan management and marketplace plan characteristics, standardized plan designs, and potential innovation for Multi-State Plan products. OPM, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement. TABLE 9.02A PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent increase in FEHB premiums FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend 3.4% 3.7% 3.2% 6.4% 4.44%≤Industry TrendMet FY 2016 Analysis of Results: In FY 2016, projected FEHB premiums increased to $503.35 from $481.94 in FY 2015. PriceWaterhouseCoopers released an analysis of private sector premiums predicting a net growth rate of 5.5 percent for premiums going into effect in 2017. In general, FEHB rates reflect changes in the healthcare market. The FEHB uses private market competition and consumer choice to provide comprehensive benefits at an affordable price. In addition, OPM negotiates with health carriers to keep premium increases as reasonable as possible. The net growth rate is inclusive of changes to plan design and patient cost sharing. In FY 2016, OPM negotiated with health carriers to keep premiums below the industry trend for 2017 plans. 114 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportAGENCY PRIORITY GOAL: FEHB PLAN PERFORMANCE Goal Statement: Improve health outcomes for the 8.2 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents enrolled in health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. In 2016, FEHB plan performance will be assessed based on a common set of measures of clinical quality, customer service and appropriate resource use; this performance assessment will be used in the determination of plan profit margins. While each plan will be assessed based on its performance, overall progress for the FEHB program will be measured by an increase in the number of FEHB plans at or above the 50 th percentile of the relevant national, commercial benchmark year-on-year as measured by FEHB plan scored values on the designated high-priority indicators used continuously during the evaluation period. These high-priority measures include: risk adjusted all cause readmissions, timeliness of prenatal care and blood pressure control. FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM executed the Plan Performance Assessment by: • conducting end-to-end testing of implementation of the Plan Performance Assessment using 2015 data; • developing a methodology for the Plan Performance Assessment Improvement Increment; • announcing measures for potential future use in the Plan Performance Assessment; • preparing processes for receipt, calculation, and reporting of 2016 Plan Performance Assessment scores; • participating in working groups examining case studies and best practices; • holding three meetings of the Plan Performance Best Practices workgroup in March, June, and August 2016 which covered root cause analysis techniques; • providing FEHB carriers an overview of the Plan Performance Assessment Improvement Increment with a carrier letter and webcast in August 2016; • researching health care performance in commercial lines of business; and • conducting ongoing analysis of the OPM measure set alignment with high-priority industry and government measures sets. All plans successfully submitted their 2016 data and confirmed OPM’s calculated scores during an October preview period. 115 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 9.02B PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of plans with timely prenatal care above the national commercial 50th percentile FY 2012 ResultsFY 2013 ResultsFY 2014 ResultsFY 2015 ResultsFY 2016 ResultsFY 2016 TargetFY 2016 Target Met/ Not Met FY 2012- FY 2016 Trend N/A* 43.4% 39.8% 41% 46% ≥41% Met FY 2016 Analysis of Results: In FY 2016, 52 of 113 FEHB plans were above the national commercial 50th percentile of 84 percent. In FY 2016, OPM assigned this measure to the highest priority in the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment, which impacts plan profit. The financial incentive helped motivate plans to encourage early prenatal care, update claims submission procedures for bundled maternity episodes to include the date of the first prenatal visit, and pursue medical records data to verify the visit date. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period.

The change to the risk adjustment methodology for this measure impacted FEHB results. Nonetheless, OPM is closely monitoring performance on this measure and working with carriers on process improvement. The agency will highlight the efforts of successful plans in an upcoming Best Practices session. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. Strategy 9.03: Improve preventive services delivery to employees, retirees, families, tribal employees, and newly insured Americans FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM began comprehensive outreach to plans regarding the prevention and treatment of addiction. In addition, OPM detailed its efforts to safely prescribe prescription pain medication and improve addiction care. OPM continued its partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, focused on reducing the stigma surrounding substance use disorder. In FY 2016, OPM also served on the Interagency Coordinating Group Executive Committee, which evaluated the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Program and research on marijuana, opioids, and other illicit drugs. OPM expects all FEHB health plans to sponsor programs that promote healthy lifestyles and help members modify health risks. Information collected from FEHB carriers indicated that too few FEHB members are participating in health risk screening and wellness activities. In FY 2016, OPM released a carrier letter on the tax implications of wellness incentives, and followed-up with guidance asking plans to limit their use of cash or cash equivalent incentives to those that are used for medical care. This guidance applies beginning with 2017 plans. OPM also released a carrier letter in FY 2016 consolidating OPM guidance on population health. The letter asked FEHB plans to emphasize the importance of screening in targeted communications. OPM also asked plans to review their programs, including those directed at diabetes prevention, obesity management, and reduction of cardiovascular risk, which may satisfy both preventive services and wellness requirements. In FY 2016, OPM also held a Federal Agency Wellness Coordinator meeting. During that meeting, participants made presentations on key wellness topics, including linking FEHB benefits to employee wellness and the status of worksite wellness across the Federal Government. 117 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report OPM also continued to emphasize the importance of vaccinations in FY 2016. In October 2016, OPM and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a joint memo to all agencies encouraging employees to get their annual flu shot. https://www.chcoc.gov/content/seasonal-flu-prevention-and-protection-federal-workforce . In addition, OPM partnered with the National Vaccine Program Office, and other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offices, on the National Adult Immunization Plan. In FY 2016, OPM began participating on an Adult Immunization Task Force. The Task Force is reviewing the plan to evaluate its strategic direction, and implementing the plan. In FY 2016, OPM worked with the National Prevention Council, supporting the development of the Healthy Aging in Action Report, which identifies Federal actions to promote prevention and wellbeing in older Americans. OPM also provided support in the development and release of the Council’s Assessments on Food Service Guidelines and Tobacco Free Policy.

The CDC originally set an 80 percent target for the percent of adults receiving flu shots in the Healthy People 2020 initiative in December 2010. The target was revised to 70 percent in 2013. Low effectiveness for flu shots has been widely reported in the media, likely impacting the desire for flu shots. OPM continues to emphasize the importance of flu shots, including through a joint memo with the Department of Health and Human Services.

In FY 2016, OPM also released a carrier letter consolidating OPM guidance on population health. In addition to the emphasis on screening and other preventive services, OPM noted that the latest Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems results suggested that tobacco use rates were declining among FEHB members. Results from the Federal Employee Benefits Survey in 2013 and 2016 reinforced this trend. There was a slight decline from 11.6 percent reporting tobacco use in FY 2013 to 11 percent in FY 2016. The overall rate of use reported by respondents to the survey remains lower than the smoking rate of 15 percent for adults in the U.S. reported by the Center for Disease Control. OPM asked plans to continue this trend by reinforcing communication about the FEHB tobacco cessation benefits to clinicians as well as members. In FY 2016, OPM participated on the Department of Defense Addictive Substance Misuse Advisory Committee for Tobacco. This work supported the Department of Defense efforts to implement a tobacco-free workplace and facilitated greater outreach to Department of Defense Civilians about the FEHB tobacco cessation benefit.

Tobacco use rates are declining among FEHB members, reducing the target audience for the tobacco cessation benefits. OPM continues to ask plans to emphasize the tobacco cessation benefit by reinforcing communication about the FEHB tobacco cessation benefits. *N/A – Not Available – no data available for this period. 119 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Strategy 9.05: Enhance outreach and health literacy FY 2016 Progress Update In FY 2016, OPM collaborated with Federal agencies to disseminate information about health benefits and coverage. For example, OPM worked with agencies and their benefits officers on identifying flu clinics and providing Federal employees and families with accurate information about flu shots. OPM also encouraged use of a Centers for Disease Control app that connects individuals with local flu vaccine clinics. OPM has also used social media to enhance outreach. For example, in FY 2016, OPM was a social media partner with the D.C. Calls It Quits Initiative, which is a partnership between the D.C. Department of Health and 40 other groups to increase tobacco cessation for D.C. area residents and workforce. TABLE 9.05 PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Percent of plans with timely prenatal care above the national commercial 50th percentile Refer to Table 9.02B. EVIDENCE BUILDING AGENCY STRATEGY TO ADVANCE THE USE OF EVIDENCE IN DECISION-MAKING OPM continues to enhance, promote, and integrate evidence-based decision making, consistent with applicable law. It is part of the fabric of the agency’s organizational culture. The practice of evidence-based decision making involves using the best available data, both quantitative and qualitative, along with scientific evidence, to make empirically supported decisions. This approach has been mainstreamed into the agency’s processes and is being pursued, as evident in the establishment of a specific strategic goal on evidence-based decision-making in the agency’s FY 2014-FY 2018 Strategic Plan. OPM is building a cohesive structure, to manage and integrate data usage across the agency and with external partners. This enables OPM to not only process and analyze data more efficiently, but to identify issues that may affect future workforce planning. This increased focus on data integration has enriched the data that OPM uses to support policy development and operations and has enabled OPM to contribute to rigorous research and evaluations. To this end, the agency hired a Senior Data Scientist who is working closely with OPM’s Senior Advisor on Research and Evaluation. The Senior Data Scientist provides expert technical assistance necessary for research and for developing research partnerships with academia. The Senior Data Scientist has started conducting independent evaluations using OPM workforce data and developing predictive analyses, such as workforce retirement estimates. This critical position will help establish the strategic direction for the agency’s research and evaluation initiatives, which is driven by the needs of the agency’s program offices to answer critical questions. In addition to building and strengthening its data analytic talent, the agency continues to leverage and engage individual components that directly support this strategy. To advance, adopt, and spread best practices that are being deployed within the agency, OPM has established an internal network of Analytic Ambassadors. The role of the Analytic Ambassador is to help promote and advance the analytical work and research being done in OPM’s program offices. 120 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportRECENT PROGRESS The agency continues its commitment and efforts for integrating data—administrative, survey, job applicant, and customer experience—into resources and tools developed for internal agency use, Government-wide use, and broader public use. T raditionally, agency data and information processes have been fragmented across program offices, making it difficult to leverage and integrate with other data systems. The agency has made great progress on developing a cohesive and collaborative structure to manage and integrate this data throughout the agency and across government. As highlighted below, the agency’s increased focus on data integration and data visualization has enriched the information that the agency uses to support policy development and operations. • The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is a powerful management tool that is driving real change. OPM continues to leverage the Enterprise Human Resources Integration-Statistical Data Mart (EHRI-SDM) administrative data in administering, analyzing, and reporting FEVS results. Integrating administrative data into the survey process enables the agency to add analytic breadth without additional respondent burden. Organizational structure, occupational series, education level, and date of birth are administrative variables that have recently been incorporated with the FEVS data. This is one example of how the agency has significantly enhanced the survey. Leveraging EHRI-SDM administrative data and working collaboratively with participating Federal agencies to implement OPM’s innovated survey methodology (the Graduated Proportional Sampling method), has dramatically increased the number of subcomponent reports—more managers receiving office-level reports—with less administrative burden. As a result, between 2012 and 2015, the number of agency components receiving survey results has increased by 229 percent. • In addition to the expansion of the available data elements and reporting breadth, the agency has established relevant Government-wide measures. For example, the FEVS team developed the Employee Engagement Index as a benchmark that is used across the Federal Government. OPM defines employee engagement as “the employee’s sense of purpose that is evident in their display of dedication, persistence, and effort in their work or overall attachment to their organization and its mission.” More recently, the agency conducted key driver analysis on the Employee Engagement Index. This type of analysis helps agencies determine specific areas in which action can be taken to help drive improvements in employee engagement. Using this data-driven approach, agencies can improve conditions that lead to an engaged workforce by targeting resources on the key drivers of the Employee Engagement Index and its three sub-factors: Leaders Lead, Supervisors, and Intrinsic Work Experience. Each sub-factor reflects a different aspect of an engaging work environment and each is assessed through questions on the FEVS. • UnlockTalent.gov is an innovative comprehensive data visualization dashboard created by OPM to help government leaders make data-driven decisions and design initiatives to improve the overall engagement and satisfaction of the Federal workforce. The dashboard incorporates administrative data from Enterprise Human Resources Integration—Statistical Data Mart (EHRI-SDM) and data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). OPM made significant strides in advancing its commitment to making data, including workforce statistics and Government-wide survey results and reports, more accessible to agencies, Federal employees, and the general public, in a manner consistent with privacy imperatives. UnlockTalent.gov delivers on this commitment. Users can view employee engagement, job satisfaction, and agency workforce data in visual formats–complete with charts, graphs, and maps. It allows for comparisons among agencies, and also provides agencies trends. 121 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report UnlockTalent.gov is developed using an agile methodology, an approach that accommodates limited budgets. Each phased enhancement to the site increases data access and functionality for users. Recent enhancements include creating multi-tier data access. When UnlockTalent.gov was first launched in July of 2014 only agency senior officials were granted access. Now members of the public are able to view agency-level data on the website and Federal employees can register to see their agency-specific dashboards with more granular data. OPM added two additional levels of access to the site: (1) an Executive User access that provides the most granular data available while protecting employees’ data confidentiality and (2) a non-FEVS agency user access for agencies that do not participate in the survey but who would like to access resources such as case studies, videos, research, and best practices under the UnlockTalent Community of Practice link. OPM plans to implement data enhancements which will allow users to gain more insight into engagement scores and identify where to take action. OPM also plans to launch a new HR Core Metrics page. This page will highlight the overall health of an agency’s workforce to include workforce demographics, hiring for the Mission Critical Occupations and STEM, Performance Culture such as telework satisfaction and promotions, Strategic Planning and Alignment, and the New Inclusion Quotient. OPM regularly updates the Unlock Talent Community of Practice with case studies, videos, training, research, best practices and other helpful resources to develop a flexible, inclusive work environment that further engages and energizes the workforce to put forth its best effort, achieve agency missions, and remain committed to public service. • USAJOBS is transforming itself into a federal career site that not only lists vacant positions but also allows for career exploration and job searches to connect the right talent to the right jobs. In FY 2015, more than 350,000 job announcements were posted on USAJOBS and 22 million applications were started. In FY 2016, USAJOBS hosted several user workshops to gather feedback on the resume mining tool that allows agencies to mine the database of searchable resumes to recruit talent for open positions, career events, and other outreach activities. The workshops resulted in the development of a more user-friendly interface to support the search and communication functions in the tool. The resume mining pilot began in September 2016 with 50 users, and the pilot has grown to over 500 users. A full rollout of the tool is expected in FY 2017. USAJOBS offers an agency service called the Agency Talent Portal that houses the resume mining feature and other data tools to support data-driven, strategic recruitment. USAJOBS marketed its Agency Talent Portal to hiring managers and HR specialists in the Hiring Excellence Campaign to showcase how to use the tools and the expected benefits to talent acquisition. The product will continue to evolve based on user feedback and partnerships to build a recruitment network that attracts the right talent to the right jobs. • USA Staffing® is OPM’s talent acquisition system for Federal agencies. The system automates Federal policies, practices, and laws for the full range of Federal hiring. USA Staffing® supports Federal hiring managers and HR professionals in acquiring, assessing, certifying, selecting, and onboarding qualified candidates in alignment with Merit System Principles. It serves as the primary interface for more than 114,000 hiring managers and over 8,000 HR professionals Government-wide, providing a conduit to USAJOBS for posting announcements and accepting, rating, and ranking applications for Federal employment. As a shared service, USA Staffing® enables more than 70 Federal agencies to meet their hiring missions. Approximately 78 percent of USAJOBS vacancy announcements are processed through USA Staffing®. 122 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report Through ongoing enhancements that reflect agency business needs and Federal best practices, USA Staffing® continues to evolve by improving usability and enhancing functionality for all key stakeholders. In April 2015, OPM deployed an upgrade to the USA Staffing® system. The upgrade uses agile software development methods, resulting in a system designed to enable Federal hiring goals such as increased hiring manager engagement, strong assessment capabilities, improved applicant experience, and advanced reporting and analytics. Furthermore, USA Staffing® is focusing on continually making enterprise-wide improvements to security and data, regularly prioritizing system functionality based on real user feedback, and expanding onboarding and classification functionality. OPM is currently providing extensive transition and change management support for agencies as they complete their transitions to the new version of USA Staffing® throughout FY 2017 and into FY 2018. USA Staffing® supports agencies in hiring the right people for the right jobs within the framework of Merit System Principles, as well as leveraging data to further understand and refine Federal hiring. For example, USA Staffing® continues to support hiring excellence by expanding the use of applicant flow data Government-wide. Applicant flow data combines the demographic information collected from USAJOBS with data from each step of the hiring process in USA Staffing®, enabling agencies to identify any barriers and pursue best practices at each stage of the hiring process. Going forward, OPM will continue to support agency efforts to recruit from all segments of society through applicant flow data enhancements. The USA Staffing® upgrade also offers a more streamlined application which is optimally integrated with USAJOBS and enables applicants to apply via mobile devices. By continually assessing applicant satisfaction levels, USA Staffing® monitors, evaluates, and makes system adjustments to provide a positive applicant experience.• HRStat is a Government-wide effort based on the GPRA Modernization Act, in which Federal agencies facilitate data-driven quarterly reviews. The agency continues to develop the HRStat program to enable agencies to improve how they collect, analyze, and report human capital data. OPM established and meets quarterly with the HRStat Community of Practice, which includes members from all 24 CHCO Act agencies. OPM, in coordination with the HRStat Community of Practice, developed the HRStat Government-wide guidance, the HRStat Maturity Model, and the HRStat Maturity Model Assessment Tool. The guidance is used to inform the practice of HRStat in conformity with 5 CFR 250. The guidance and the tool were designed to help the agencies continue their quarterly data-driven reviews and make progress against their identified goals. The key areas addressed by the guidance and the tool are critical to the effectiveness and sustainability of the HRStat program. • Skills-Gap Closure Strategies Using Data Analysis: The agency is implementing a data-driven, multi-factor model and environmental scan approach to identify Government-wide skills-gap areas. This is a collaborative partnership with the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council’s formal Executive Steering Committee for Skills Gaps. This multi-factor model approach identifies those Government-wide and agency-specific Mission-Critical Occupations (MCOs) that have the greatest risk for experiencing skills gaps. Based on input from Federal workforce planning Subject Matter Experts, the model was adjusted to enable it to meet agencies’ needs. OPM used the multi-factor model to conduct analysis on all of the 24 executive agency’s Mission Critical Occupations to determine which occupations were at greatest risk. OPM used the results to identify six Government-wide occupations (cybersecurity, economist, auditor, acquisition, human resources, and STEM as a functional area). OPM 123 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report also identified 48 unique agency-specific occupations across the 24 executive agencies. OPM developed and implemented the first Government-wide environmental scanning process. The qualitative data from the process reinforced the identification of the Government-wide Mission Critical Occupations. Additional information garnered from the process will support the identification of how occupations and skills will evolve so that the information can be incorporated into the development of human capital strategies that will address current and future skill gaps. Also, OPM led the effort to support the Federal Agency Skills Teams (the Government-wide and agency teams responsible for identifying root causes, developing action plans, and establishing and monitoring metrics) by providing the training and supporting guidance to complete each requirement. In addition, to institutionalize the skills gaps method, OPM revised Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 250, subpart B. Agencies will be responsible to use the OPM designated method to identify skill gaps, monitor and address skill gaps within Government-wide and agency Mission Critical Occupations, describe the skills and human capital information required to achieve agency goals and objectives within agency strategic plans, and include explicit descriptions of agency skill and competency gaps. • Re-Design of Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Plan Choice: Each year, more than four million Federal employees and retirees have the opportunity to consider changing to another health plan from among the more than 250 health plan options available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. A hallmark of the FEHB Program is the wide range of options members can choose from to best meet their needs and the needs of their families. In plan year 2016, enrollees were able to choose from 92 plans and 252 plan options. During open season, typically the second week in November through the first two weeks of December, Federal employees and annuitants have the option to change or continue their enrollment with their health plan. With the large number of plan options and the number of factors to consider (that is, price, quality, provider networks), this can often be a daunting task, and many who could potentially benefit from changing plans, may opt not to. OPM is using the literature about health plan decision-making and decision aid design to re-design of the Plan Comparison Tool. A revised Plan Comparison Tool reinforces OPM’s longstanding commitment to enrollee choice and should increase the number of FEHB members who annually review their options. It will also contribute to the agency’s strategic goal to attract and retain a diverse Federal workforce. The agency is using an agile methodology for the development and design of the Plan Comparison Tool. This methodology will allow the agency to respond to unpredictability through an incremental and iterative work process, as more data elements become available through Benefits Plus–FEHB’s new administrative/management database. A cross-agency team is working to align the OPM comparison tool with industry-wide standards, create the capability to customize the plan selection process, and incorporate the latest behavioral economics and choice theory findings about user preferences and consumer selection of health coverage. • FEHB will initiate Plan Comparison Tool updates each year for the next several years. This approach fits with the agile development methodology and accommodates limited budgets. It also allows the FEHB program to learn consumer preferences for the Plan Comparison Tool updates. Future enhancements will likely include cost calculators. • Convene a Research Summit: To develop partnerships with agencies, academic institutions, and think tanks, OPM held its 124 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Reportinaugural Research Summit in partnership with the School of Public Affairs at American University. This inaugural summit was dedicated to connecting research and policy. It was a collaborative meeting that showcased peer-reviewed published research that used OPM and other Federal data. The Research Summit brought together over 150 academic researchers, federal practitioners, and industry partners to exchange ideas, collaborate, and participate in critical conversations about research and pressing policy issues within six human capital areas: work/life issues; benefits; performance management; diversity and inclusion; leadership; and employee engagement. Summit attendees discovered new solutions, learned from best practices, and gained a better understanding on how to incorporate research and data into policy-decision making. OPM continues to strengthen these partnerships to leverage data sets, analytic capabilities, and research findings. To further this effort, OPM is evaluating the benefits and challenges of using partnerships for external analytic capabilities related to data-driven evidence-based policy making, and determining the feasibility of expanding the use of these partnerships. CURRENT BARRIERS OPM seeks to enhance its infrastructure, technology, data sharing within and across agencies, and data security and privacy as the agency implements its strategy to increase the use of evidence in decision-making. Despite some challenges, OPM continues to make progress in using and expanding access to data, as well as in creating, rebuilding, and enhancing data analytics tools for both internal and external stakeholders. • Talent Gap: Finding people who can work with new and emerging technologies, ask the right questions, and interpret large quantities of data to find meaningful insights continues to be a challenge.• Data Access and Infrastructure: OPM’s existing IT and data infrastructure do not yet support the more complex, interactive, and real-time data analytics that might be possible with more enhanced systems. The resulting limitations on insight into real-time data could result in the agency making business and policy-critical decisions without the best possible data. An environment where data is standardized, readily accessible by authorized personnel, and allows for real-time data analysis, would improve data integrity and increase data accessibility. FY 2016 FINDINGS OPM employees led noteworthy original research in FY 2016, to include the publication of articles and white papers, a book on Complex Survey Data Analysis, and over 20 conference presentations. In addition, OPM has entered into two major research agreements, collaborating with five universities. One agreement focuses on the evaluation of the Veterans Employment initiative and the second agreement focuses on the impact of the automatic enrollment policy on employee TSP contributions. OPM Internal Research: • Synthetic Data: OPM hosted a roundtable discussion on best practices of balancing data release and data protection with data disclosure experts from Duke University and the U.S. Census Bureau. For many big datasets, the confidentiality risks associated with disseminating the data may be so high that it is nearly impossible to share record-level data without massive data alterations or highly redacting the data. Unfortunately, in many cases data alterations and/or redactions severely reduce the data quality, and call into question the usefulness of the data being released. The roundtable focused on the use of synthetic data. Synthetic data is a cutting-edge data disclosure method through which original data values with high disclosure risk are replaced with values simulated from statistical models estimated on the confidential data. Applying 125 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report this technique to OPM data would allow us to protect personally identifiable information (PII) while enabling analysts and researchers to access record level data with simulated values. OPM is pilot testing this synthetic data method to generate the 2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey public-release data file (PRDF). OPM has created and released a FEVS-PRDF with each survey administration. Although most items on the FEVS are attitudinal, there are a number of demographic variables that could potentially be used to disclose a respondent’s identity. Previous disclosure avoidance strategy for releasing the FEVS-PRDF began by removing variables with PII and collapsing certain categories of the observable demographics such as gender or supervisory status. At a minimum, a work unit required at least 250 respondents to have its unique identifier maintained in the PRDF . A downside to this data disclosure method is that the modifications made to the original survey data can result in a significant loss of information, particularly if substantive variations exist amongst combined or masked work unit identifiers or demographic categories. The 2016 FEVS-PRDF is a partially synthetic data file; only the demographic variables are synthesized. The rational for using a partially synthetic method is based on the idea that only the sensitive or “key” variables that could be used for identification are synthesized and the less sensitive attitudinal variables can remain intact. • Employee Engagement Key Driver Analysis: Research in both academia and the private-sector have consistently indicated that engagement can affect employees’ attitudes, levels of absenteeism and turnover, productivity, as well as organizational performance. While an engaged workforce is essential to achieving the critical work of the Federal Government, few analyses have been conducted to help guide and inform agency leaders about which actions to take to strengthen employee engagement. OPM conducted in-depth statistical analyses in which the agency identified and examined the impact of nine different factors on the FEVS Employee Engagement Index across selected groups of Federal employees, selected agencies, and Government-wide. These nine factors were: (1) Collaborative/Cooperative Management, (2) Employee T raining and Development, (3) Job Resources, (4) Merit System Principles, (5) Performance Feedback, (6) Performance Rating, (7) Performance Recognition and Reward, (8) Supportive Coworkers, and (9) Work/Life Balance. OPM also examined the extent to which these nine factors were key drivers of the three sub-indices of the Employee Engagement Index: Leaders Lead, Supervisors, and Intrinsic Work Experience. Based upon the results of the analysis, we recommend agencies take steps to improve employee engagement through deliberate and concerted efforts across the five key drivers for the Employee Engagement Index: (1) Performance Feedback; (2) Collaborative/Cooperative Management; (3) Merit System Principles; (4) Employee T raining and Development; and (5) Work/Life Balance. Key findings from the current analysis, GAO’s report, research on private-sector organizations, and promising practices identified in the Employee Engagement Senior Accountable Official (SAO) Workshops indicate employee engagement is likely to be higher when certain conditions exists. By identifying the key drivers, OPM can refocus attention on and prioritize specific management practices that are most likely to improve the conditions that lead to engagement. It is important to remember that different actions may increase the level of engagement of different employees, and that not every recommendation may be a good fit with every organizational culture. Managers and human resources professionals should determine how best to tailor key driver findings to best fit their organization and the individuals within those organizations.

The data set consisted of more than 35 million records for approximately 3.8 million distinct Federal employees. This is the first analysis of Federal data where OPM tracked individual employees throughout their Federal career and analyzed retirement patterns for the entire workforce–not just individuals who are eligible to retire. OPM also analyzed the data by retirement plan (the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System). Preliminary findings indicate that although the percentage of Federal employees eligible to retire has increased from 6.3 percent in 1996 to 16.2 percent in 2015, the percentage has remained largely unchanged since 2010. Moreover, the overall retirement rate has remained fairly stable over the years at approximately 3 percent. Taken together, these findings imply that on the average, there is a growing tendency for Federal employees to stay onboard longer after reaching retirement eligibility. • Evaluating Federal Employee Benefits: The Federal Employee Benefits Survey (FEBS) is designed to measure the importance, adequacy, and perceived value of the benefits available to Federal employees. The survey was first administered in 2004, then again in 2006, 2011, 2013, and 2016. The 2016 FEBS was expanded to capture information about the impact some benefit programs may have on employee recruitment and retention. The current survey also incorporated questions to assess how well employees understand the benefit programs in which they are enrolled. Some of the most noteworthy takeaways from the survey results include:1. The prevalence of benefit programs remained consistent from 2013 to 2016 FEBS administrations. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) have proven to be the most prevalent according to survey respondents. 2. Reported enrollment in both the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) notably increased between 2013 and 2016. 3. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated 16.8 percent of U.S. adults smoked cigarettes, which demonstrated a decrease from 20.9 percent in 2005. The rate has continued to decline, with the CDC reporting in 2016 that the U.S. adult smoking rate has fallen to 15 percent. This represents the biggest one-year decline in more than 20 years. Although the reported tobacco use rate among FEBS respondents did not see a comparative decline between the 2013 and 2016 FEBS administrations, the overall use rate reported by survey respondents continues to be lower than that of the general population. Overall, the results of the FEBS guide Federal benefits policy. OPM uses the results of the FEBS to ensure that currently available Federal benefits align with best practices and employee needs. The results also help OPM evaluate whether or not Federal employees understand the flexibilities and benefits available to them.

The performance information in this report is reasonably complete and reliable, as defined by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010. The following section describes the steps that OPM has taken to ensure the performance information it reports for each measure is accurate, complete, and reliable. Additionally, the following steps outline how the agency promotes data quality: • OPM has developed and regularly updates dashboards with the agency’s performance results, facilitating senior management review. Senior agency leaders participate in performance dashboard reviews every one to two months. This process includes substantiating that actual results reported are indeed correct whenever those results reveal substantial changes in trends or variances from targets. • The OCFO provides guidance to goal teams on data quality, and has developed a standard form for goal teams to document data collection and reporting procedures, definitions, source data, validation and verification, and limitations. The Office reviews such documentation for adequacy, providing feedback and recommendations for improvement to goal teams. This documentation serves as a job aid to performance measurement and reporting staff, helping to promote the use of consistent definitions and methods. • To reduce the risk of human error, the OCFO is developing a single repository for all performance results. • The OCFO and Goal Owners assess the use and effectiveness of the agency’s performance measures and consider alternative measures during the agency’s annual performance budgeting process. Cross-organizational teams of Goal Owners establish consensus on the validity of the measures. These agency-wide efforts, in addition to the specific actions that Goal Owners have taken for each measure, described in the following section, support the completeness, reliability, and quality of OPM’s performance information. 128 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportMEASURE DEFINITIONS, DATA SOURCES, VERIFICATION, AND VALIDATION STRATEGIC GOAL 1: ATTRACT AND ENGAGE A DIVERSE AND EFFECTIVE OPM WORKFORCE TABLE 1.01 Performance Measure Percent of USA Staffing ® hiring actions for which OPM managers reviewed applicant flow data Definition The number of OPM selections made through USA Staffing® after applicant flow data have been reviewed by either OPM HR or hiring managers to help recruitment for future hiring actions divided by the number of selections.

TABLE 1.02A Performance Measure OPM’s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey Employee Engagement Index score Definition The percent of employees providing positive survey responses to the 15 items included in the Employee Engagement Index. The Engagement Index comprised the following subfactors and items: • Leaders Lead: Reflects the employees’ perceptions of the integrity of leadership, as well as leadership behaviors such as communication and workforce motivation. (Q 53, 54, 56, 60, and 61) • Supervisors: Reflects the interpersonal relationship between worker and supervisor, including trust, respect, and support. (Q 47 , 48, 49, 51, and 52) • Intrinsic Work Experience: Reflects the employees’ feelings of motivation and competency relating to their role in the workplace. (Q 3, 4, 6, 11, and 12) The index score is calculated by dividing the number of employees satisfied/very satisfied on each of the 15 items in the index by the total number of respondents, and then averaging the percentages.

Data Source Strategic Goal 5 Transparent and Responsive Budgets: Customer Satisfaction Survey Frequency Annually Verification and Validation As part of the verification process, responses to the survey item were checked for appropriate and accurate coding (for example, there were no out of range responses and responses corresponded with survey skip patterns). Double-checking the coding of each survey item enhanced data quality by ensuring the data file was as accurate, complete, and reliable as possible. Prior to administration, a survey link was emailed to employees in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (who had the option to share the link with others) to serve as a pilot of the survey items. These “testers” were asked to provide feedback about the survey aesthetics as well as the item wording. Regarding the wording, testers were asked to comment on whether each item measured what it was intended to measure—that is, did the question capture the needed information? Was the question clearly worded? Was the question understandable? Based upon the feedback, edits to several survey items were made and the revised survey measures were used. These efforts were taken to enhance the face validity of the survey items and reduce measurement error. Data Limitations Data and results were based upon the responses from those who voluntarily completed the survey and who self-identified as performing budget-related activities. These responses provide an accurate portrayal of their perceptions and experiences regarding the information received about the Agency’s budget processes, activities, and tools. However, the number of actual budget users is currently unknown. Thus, it is likely that the voluntary nature of the survey and self-identification as a budget user underestimate the actual number of users. All samples are subject to multiple sources of error, including but not limited to sampling error, coverage error, and measurement error. While these types of errors cannot be totally eliminated from survey research, efforts were taken to diminish the potential impact of these errors for this survey. To minimize sampling error and coverage error, a complete and updated list of employees was obtained from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. To reduce coverage error and improve response rates, multiple email reminders were sent and the time to take the survey was extended by one week. Lastly, the survey items were pilot tested to minimize measurement error. Despite these potential limitations, the data is sufficiently accurate, valid, and reliable for the purpose of exploring whether OPM’s budget processes are transparent and responsive to users. 140 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance ReportTABLE 5.01B Performance Measure Percent of stakeholders who agree that OPM’s budget processes and activities are responsive to their needs Definition The number of survey respondents who identified as budget users who agreed or strongly agreed that OPM’s budget processes and activities are responsive to their needs divided by the number of survey respondents who identified as budget users.

The scores are made up of the following FEVS items: • In my organization, senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce. (Q 53) • My organization’s senior leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity. (Q 54) • Managers communicate the goals and priorities of the organization. (Q 56) • Overall, how good a job do you feel is being done by the manager directly above your immediate supervisor? (Q 60) • I have a high level of respect for my organization’s senior leaders. (Q 61) The number of components of CHCO organizations with scores rounded to the nearest number that increased at least one percentage point is divided by the total number of CHCO agency sub-components, which includes the selected components of the CHCO agencies that were identified in accordance with the 2014 joint OPM-OMB memorandum to agency heads on strengthening employee engagement and organizational performance (OMB-M-15-04). Data Source Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey Frequency Annually Verification and Validation Survey data is verified through 11 separate data processing steps, including electronic and manual data quality controls. Once the FEVS data are uploaded to the dashboard, analysts conduct systematic data checks against 20 percent of the agencies (across large, medium, and small agencies). Each OPM subcomponent that receives an individual score is responsible for data analysis and action planning. While the survey is voluntary, OPM’s response rate of more than 70 percent has resulted in a statistically significant sample of the OPM employee population. OPM’s Planning and Policy Analysis leads the survey administration and conducts extensive data analysis to verify the validity of this index.

Data Source Human Resource Solutions Customer Satisfaction Survey Frequency Semi-Annually Verification and Validation All data is double checked by CMS analysts. If anomalies appear, Human Resource Solutions experts are employed to review the data. Random checks are used to ensure data on the central spreadsheet reflects data downloaded from the survey platform. To develop valid items for this survey instrument, OPM reviewed extensive research on “customer satisfaction” in the fields of organizational psychology, management, and marketing. From this literature, OPM identified nine underlying service dimensions of customer satisfaction, including the courtesy, knowledge, and timeliness of the service staff as well as the extent of choice and quality for the specific service. OPM developed a set of survey scales with 20 core items for these nine dimensions, along with four general items about overall quality and satisfaction. The core items were pretested with staff in three agencies before the measures were included in OPM’s customer satisfaction surveys. Data Limitations The data is based on a chosen sample, rather than a random or randomized sampling technique. All samples are subject to multiple sources of error, including, but not limited to sampling error, coverage area, and measurement error. 155 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 8.03C Performance Measure Percent of HR specialists who complete at least one course on HR University (HRU) Definition The number of HR specialists who complete at least one course on HRU divided by the total number of HR specialists Data Source OPM’s database of all registered HRU users Frequency Quarterly Verification and Validation Raw data are checked against registrations and prior baselines.

Data Source Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Health and Human Services, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and other contracted issuers Frequency Annually Verification and Validation OPM compares data from issuers and CMS. Data Limitations The results are imprecise because the number depends on the point in time in which the measurement was taken. Enrollees on the Exchanges do not always maintain coverage for an entire year. Typically the total enrollment declines as the year progresses. This is true for all health plans offered in the Exchanges, not just Multi-State Plan options. Further, CMS only obtains enrollment for products in the states using the Federally-Facilitated Marketplace, not the State Based Marketplaces.

Data Source National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA); Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS); Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Frequency Annually Verification and Validation OPM reviews apparent anomalies in results and consults with the NCQA when required. This leads to increased understanding of the results for the agency. OPM believes that the NCQA is exceedingly aware of the importance of the veracity and the credibility of its data since it is used nationwide by hundreds of health plans to monitor and improve services. This sensitivity extends to NCQA’s internal application of expert statistical methodology as well as to the use of professional external audits of NCQA’s findings, which precede the issuance of results each year. NCQA is a leading healthcare measures steward, and develops, tests, and evaluates measures for error or bias, updating measure specifications annually. OPM instructs plans to follow these specifications (available at Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Quality Measures Clearinghouse). NCQA-certified auditors then validate data submissions before they are submitted to NCQA. This includes both the measure results and the data used to develop the benchmarks in Quality Compass. Data Limitations Due to the data reporting, verification, and validation process, the measure results reported to OPM are based on prior-year experience of the population. TABLE 9.02A Performance Measure Percent increase in Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) premiums Definition The increase in the amount of FEHB premiums divided by the prior year premium amount, based on a projected population (using the current year’s population with the next year’s rates). Premiums are weighted using the headcounts for each plan. Data Source OPM spreadsheet with FEHB headcount information and FEHB plan information Frequency Annually Verification and Validation Three actuaries review and compare results, and conduct reasonableness tests for the FEHB headcount information. Data Limitations This measure reflects premiums set in the current fiscal year, going into effect for health plans the following year. This premium increase measure is a projection based on population in the year in which premiums were set, not the actual population of the plans affected by the premium increase. 159 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report TABLE 9.02B Performance Measure Percent of plans with timely prenatal care above the national commercial 50th percentile Definition The number of FEHB plans in which plan member respondents experiencing live birth deliveries received a prenatal care visit as a member of the FEHB plan in the first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment in the organization, divided by the number of FEHB plans.

Actual population for FY 2016 premiums will not be available until 2017 . Additionally, OPM reports premium increases using the measure Percent increase in FEHB premiums for all other reporting (including during the rollout of FEHB Open Season). OPM decided to report the premium change in one way (using a static population) for clarity for enrollees, stakeholders, and the general public. The information is most relevant during the open enrollment period and the only stable number that OPM can present at that time is the static population number. 9.02 Growth of FEHB prescription drug costsDiscontinued measure This measure is based on self-reported data from health plans. Health plans may differ in how they report pharmacy claims and beneficiaries. Additionally, plans may be using estimates. Finally, reporting does not account for drug claims that are part of the medical benefit. OPM has limited means of validating the data submitted by plans, reducing the usefulness of this measure. 163 OPM Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Performance Report MEASURES NOT TRACKED Strategy Performance Measure Reason 4.03 Deviation from Service Level Agreement cost of OPM infrastructure servicesOPM was unable to establish a baseline for this measure in FY 2016 as resources were allocated to other agency priorities. 4.03 Percent of non-OPM users required to use multi-factor authentication to access OPM High Value Asset systemsThe Identify Management implementation team will be formulating a strategy for this in Q1 FY 2017 and will provide additional information once the strategy is formulated. 4.03 Percent of network covered by Phase 2 Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation capabilitiesPhase 2 will not begin until FY 2017 . 7.03 Average number of days to process court-ordered benefit casesThe system used to track court ordered benefits is undergoing modifications.

Performance ReportMessage from the Director Kiran Ahuja, DirectorIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) advanced agency and Administration priorities that strengthen and empower the Federal workforce. The first year of implementation for OPM’s FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan brought both successes and challenges for the agency, as OPM worked to position the Federal Government as a model employer, transform its organizational capacity and capability, create a human-centered customer experience, and provide innovative and data-driven solutions to enable agencies to meet their missions. In this report, OPM shares its progress toward achieving the objectives in the FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility OPM worked to implement the Biden-Harris Administration’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Executive Order, leading an ambitious initiative to advance those values in Federal hiring and employment practices. OPM launched the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council to implement and sustain a national strategy for DEIA across the Federal Government. OPM also supported agencies in developing their DEIA strategic plans and established a Government-wide DEIA Learning Community through which the agency hosted learning events for Federal employees working on DEIA initiatives. OPM included DEIA-specific items in the FY 2022 OPM Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, which resulted in a baseline score of 68 percent for a new Government-wide DEIA Index. Agencies will use their DEIA Index scores to help gauge progress towards the objectives of their agency DEIA strategic plans. Building the Skills of the Federal Workforce We need to fill mission-driven positions, from economists to climate scientists to technologists, in order to support essential work across Government. OPM assisted agencies to reach more than 75 percent of hiring targets for FY 2022 and 53 percent of hiring targets for FY 2023 for jobs needed to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. OPM also established the Hiring Experience Group, a new organization, dedicated to improving the hiring experience for applicants, hiring managers, and human resources practitioners. The agency also issued a new hiring authority for college graduates and post-secondary students, providing agencies with additional flexibility to hire qualified post-secondary students for positions in the competitive service. The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) program, the Federal Government’s premier pipeline for emerging leaders at the entry level, placed 511 finalists in FY 2022, which is the second largest number of placements in program history. In addition, by focusing on merit-based reforms that will increase the use of valid, competency-based assessments as an alternative to the reliance on education credentials, agencies can recruit from a broader pool of candidates, and managers will be better able to identify skills and abilities prior to hiring. In FY 2022, 78.6 percent of respondents in OPM’s Government-wide Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) agreed that their work units have the job-relevant knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish organizational goals, short of the FY 2022 target of 83 percent. To improve upon this result, we will continue to support agencies as they increase their use of alternative assessments to replace or augment self-report questionnaires 4 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportEmbracing the Future of the Federal Workforce OPM is developing a strategic vision for the Federal Government to prepare for the Future of the Federal Workforce, and in FY 2022, nearly 82 percent of CHCOs reported that they have the necessary guidance and resources from OPM to inform their planning. OPM created a Future of the Workforce website to support agencies in transitioning to a hybrid work environment with resources and tools. OPM also developed a series of toolkits and resources designed to support agencies in the transition to a hybrid work environment that maximizes efficiency, productivity, the benefits of in-person interaction, and work-life benefits. The agency also leveraged lessons learned throughout the pandemic to update guidance on flexible work hours, telework, and remote work to empower agencies to effectively deliver on their mission and compete for top talent in a changing labor market. In addition, OPM added a remote location feature to USAJOBS to allow agencies to advertise remote positions and allow applicants to filter jobs, and to enable OPM to analyze outcomes. Improving Customer Experience for Job Applicants and Retirees OPM has taken steps to improve the experiences of its customers, with a particular focus on its two OMB-designated High-Impact Service Providers: USAJOBS and Retirement Services. To promote transparency about the size of the applicant pool for a job opportunity and set realistic expectations about competition for Federal positions, OPM completed a successful pilot of an Applicant Counts feature on USAJOBS. To enhance applicant communications, OPM created a Resume Readiness & FAQ handout to share with applicants and other stakeholders. The agency also developed the first two of a series of USAJOBS videos. The videos help job applicants navigate the Federal application and hiring process and better understand the meaning of eligible versus qualified in a job announcement. In FY 2022, OPM achieved overall satisfaction scores of 3.88 and 4.23 for the USAJOBS desktop and mobile sites, respectively. While we did not meet the desktop site target of 3.90, we improved upon FY 2021 scores for both sites. Also in FY 2022, OPM deployed a new login process ( Login.gov ) for Retirement Services Online, which is OPM’s portal that allows annuitants to manage their accounts online. Login.gov provides a single sign-on solution for Government websites that enables citizens to access public services across different agencies using the same email address and password and provides a more seamless and secure user experience. Also in FY 2022, OPM implemented a cloud-based Retirement Services contact center that increased its capability to receive customer concerns and inquires by minimizing busy signals, allowing more customers into the call queue, and allowing customers to request a callback. By leveraging the new call center system’s workforce management application, OPM can better adjust staff schedules in real-time to maximize phone coverage. In FY 2022, OPM handled 1,482,681 calls, which is 134,911 more calls than in FY 2021. However, the average call wait time of 31 minutes for FY 2022 was substantially above the target of 5 minutes. To help reduce call wait times in FY 2023, we plan to improve the content on our website and implement a retirement guide. OPM’s Retirement Services achieved an overall satisfaction score of 3.74 in FY 2022, which is below the target of 4.00 and less than the FY 2021 result of 3.92. To help us better understand the potential drivers of satisfaction and make targeted improvements, in FY 2023, we will launch an updated customer satisfaction survey focused on the new annuitant’s experience applying for and receiving retirement benefits. Conclusion An effective and inclusive workforce is indispensable to the Federal Government’s ability to meet the complex global and domestic challenges that face our nation. Put simply, people are our biggest asset, and OPM plays a critical role in delivering on Administration imperatives. I want to thank the OPM workforce for their efforts over the past year. In the year ahead, we will build on our progress, using the data in this report to inform decision-making to achieve our goals and objectives. Signed, Kiran A. Ahuja Director March 13, 2023 5OPM Overview U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) serves as the chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the Federal Government. OPM provides human resources leadership and support to Federal agencies and helps the Federal workforce achieve their aspirations as they serve the American people. OPM directs human resources and employee management services, administers retirement benefits, manages health insurance and other insurance benefit programs, and oversees merit-based and inclusive hiring into the civil service . The agency also promotes the efficiency a nd integrity of Government services through personnel vetting policies and processes for a trusted workforce. Key Functions Human Capital Management Leadership OPM ’s divisions, offices, and their employees implement the programs and deliver the services that enable the agency to meet its strategic goals and enable other agencies to meet their strategic goals. OPM works in several broad categories to lead and serve the Federal Government in enterprise human resource management by delivering policies and services to achieve a trusted, effective civilian workforce . These categories include Human Capital Management Leadership, Benefits, and Personnel Vetting. Policy OPM interprets and enforces governing law and provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing, and promulgating Government-wide human capital systems, programs, and policies that support the current and emerging needs of Federal agencies. In addition, the agency provides technical support and guidance to agencies on the full range of human capital management policies and practices, including recruitment, hiring policy and classification, veterans’ employment, strategic workforce planning, pay, leave, performance OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance Reportmanagement and recognition, leadership and employee development, diversity and inclusion, work/life/wellness programs, accountability, labor and employee relations, and the Administrative Law Judges Program. OPM’s leadership in these areas enables the Federal Government to anticipate drivers that will influence and impact the Federal workforce. OPM also reviews agency requests to exercise certain Government-wide personnel management authorities that are centrally administered or subject to OPM approval under law and oversees the implementation of key Administration priorities and goals concerning Government-wide human capital management matters. 6 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportServices OPM provides customized human capital services and training to Federal agencies to help maximize their organizational and individual performance and to drive their mission results. Utilizing the agency’s internal human capital and human-centered design experts, shared service providers within Government, and/or Government contractors, OPM’s human resources solutions help agencies design effective organizations, recruit and hire top talent, develop and cultivate leaders, build Federal human resource professional capability, improve the performance management process, and achieve long-lasting human capital results. OPM provides agencies with access to pre-competed private sector contractors through a unique partnership between OPM and GSA as part of the Government-wide Category Management effort. The private contractors, comprised of large and small companies, complement OPM’s internal capabilities in the areas of training and development, human capital management, and organizational performance improvement. OPM’s involvement facilitates the delivery of services that are both effective and compliant with operative civil service law. OPM provides a leadership development continuum that enables Federal executives, managers, and aspiring leaders to acquire knowledge and master skills so they can lead within a rapidly changing Government environment. Anchored by the Federal Executive Institute, OPM’s leadership development infrastructure and programs also include the Presidential Management Fellows Program, the Federal HR Institute, the Process and Performance Improvement program, the Lab at OPM (human centered design), and USALearning. OPM generates Government-wide benefits through Human Resources Information Technology consolidation, standardization, and modernization. OPM offers Federal systems such as Enterprise Human Resource Integration, USA Learning®, USA Staffing®, USA Hire℠, and USA Performance®. OPM is also developing the necessary information technology infrastructure to facilitate the exchange of human resources data and information Government-wide, as appropriate. In addition, OPM leads the Government-wide transformation of human resources information technology by focusing on modernization, integration, and performance assessment. OPM maintains U SAJOBS ®, the official job site of the Federal Government. It is the one-stop source for Federal jobs and employment information by which, among other things, Federal agencies meet the legal obligations to provide public notice of Federal employment opportunities to Federal employees and American citizens . The USAJOBS website is the portal for Federal recruitment for most Government positions, whether the positions are in the competitive or excepted service. Oversight Through OPM ’s oversight evaluation work, special studies, and collaboration with agencies, OPM assesses whether Federal human resources programs and human capital management systems are effective and consistent with merit system principles and related civil service requirements. OPM works directly with agencies to make improvements or changes to programs that are ineffective, ine fficient, or not in compliance with Federal law to help them achieve compliance and mission objectives. OPM also adjudicates classification appeals, job grading appeals, Fair Labor Standards Act claims, compensation and leave claims, and declination of reasonable` appeals, which provide Federal employees with procedural rights to c hallenge compensation and related agency decisions. Benefits Federal Benefits for Employees and Annuitants OPM facilitates access to the high-caliber health and other insurance programs offered by the Federal Government. This includes health insurance, dental and vision insurance, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, and long-term care insurance. OPM manages insurance benefits for more than eight million Federal employees, annuitants, and their families, employees of tribal organizations and schools, and other eligible persons. In 2019, OPM also began offering dental and vision plans to individuals who are eligible as military retirees and their families, members of the Retired Reserve, non-active Medal of Honor recipients, or survivors and family members of active-duty service members. 7 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportThese high-quality benefits make Federal employment more attractive, enabling agencies to compete for good candidates with other potential employers. Retirement OPM is responsible for the administration of the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System covering 2.8 million active employees, including the United States Postal Service, and nearly 2.7 million annuitants, including survivors. OPM also administers, develops, and provides Federal employees, annuitants, and their families with benefits programs and services that offer choice, value, and quality to help maintain the Government’s position as a competitive employer. Activities include record maintenance and service credit accounts prior to retirement; initial eligibility determinations at retirement; adjudication of annuity benefits based on age and service, disability, or death based on a myriad of statutes and regulations; post-retirement changes due to numerous life events; health and life insurance enrollments; Federal and state tax deductions; as well as other payroll functions. Personnel Vetting OPM is responsible for prescribing suitability, fitness, and credentialing standards for Government employees and contractors. It works closely with the Director of National Intelligence to determine investigative standards. The agency issues guidelines and instructions to the heads of other agencies to promote uniformity and effectiveness when executing their delegated responsibilities, and OPM conducts oversight of agencies’ programs and processes in this area, including oversight of suitability and credentialing investigations. OPM retains jurisdiction of suitability adjudications in circumstances where a Government-wide bar of an individual from Federal service is necessary to promote efficiency and protect the integrity of the civil service. The agency also provides Government-wide training for adjudicators that conforms to Government-wide training standards.History On January 16, 1883, President Chester A. Arthur signed the Civil Service Act of 1883. Among other things, the Act established OPM’s predecessor agency, the United States Civil Service Commission. Prior to 1883, Federal employment was largely based on political affiliation or personal connections, a system known as the “spoils system,” rather than applicants’ knowledge, skills, and abilities. The merit system ushered in a new era and created a competitive civil service, which emphasized an applicant’s relative level of qualifications for the position being sought, after fair and open competition. Theodore Roosevelt served as a Civil Service Commissioner from 1889-1895. His energetic and reform-minded outlook made him a strong proponent of the merit system as both Commissioner and later as U.S. President. Another milestone in OPM’s history occurred in 1978. With the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Civil Service Commission was abolished and reorganized into four new organizations: the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board (which included an office that would later become a fifth separate agency--the Office of Special Counsel); the Federal Labor Relations Authority; and the Office of Government Ethics. Each of these new organizations took over a portion of the Civil Service Commission’s responsibilities, with OPM responsible, among other things, for hiring and personnel management of the civil service of the Government. Profile OPM maintains its headquarters in the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Office Building at 1900 E Street, NW , Washington, D.C. The agency has field offices in 18 locations across the country, and operating centers in Pennsylvania and Georgia. OPM’s FY 2022 gross budget, including appropriated, mandatory administrative authorities and revolving fund activities, totaled more than $2.27 billion. In FY 2022, the agency had 2,560 full-time equivalent employees. OPM’s discretionary budget, excluding the Office of the Inspector General, was $339,648,000. For more information about OPM, please refer to the agency’s website, OPM .gov . 8 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportPurpose and Scope The FY 2022 Annual Performance Report (APR) provides an overview of OPM’s progress in implementing the strategies and achieving the objectives and goals in its FY 2022-FY 2026 Strategic Plan. The APR is issued concurrently with OPM’s FY 2024 Congressional Budget Justification and Annual Performance Plan and is intended to be used by Congress in reviewing the agency’s budget proposals. It is also intended to help Congress, the President, and the public assess OPM’s stewardship over the financial resources entrusted to the agency in FY 2022. The FY 2022 APR meets reporting requirements in the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, which focuses on improving performance and accountability in Federal agencies, and in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11. The report does not include performance information for additional mission activities aligned to key functions or additional mission support activities. This includes certain functions required by statute, regulation, or Executive Order, as well as certain information technology, contracting, facilities and security, financial management, and overhead functions that are difficult to align directly with a specific strategic goal within the Strategic Plan. The objectives in OPM’s FY 2022-FY 2026 Strategic Plan are the primary units of analysis in this report. As part of its annual performance budgeting process, the agency developed performance measures and targets aligned to the objectives. The targets indicate the agency’s planned levels of performance and were set based on the amount of resources requested for each objective. In this report, the agency compares these planned levels of performance to actual performance, explaining any variances or trends. OPM identifies successful or promising practices, and describes plans for improvement where targets were not met. Under separate cover, OPM publishes an Agency Financial Report, focusing on financial results.

Office of the Executive Secretariat, Privacy, and Information Management (OESPIM) will be established to bring together the complementary functions of the Office of Privacy and Information Management (OPIM) and the Executive Secretariat, which had been in the Office of the Director. OPIM was originally established to elevate and co-locate certain important and complementary subject matter areas and, in so doing, call attention to their significance in the day-to-day business operations of OPM and facilitate proper resource allocation for the work performed. These functions include Privacy; Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); Records Management; Forms Management/Paperwork Reduction Act; and Controlled Unclassified Information. In the newly established OESPIM, led by a Senior Executive Service (SES) Executive Director, the OPIM functions will be combined with the Executive Secretariat functions, which include responsibility for coordination and review of agency correspondence, policy and program proposals, regulations, and legislation; and serving as the agency’s regulatory interface with the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Register. Office of the General Counsel (OGC) provides legal advice and representation to the Director and OPM managers and leaders so they can work to provide the Federal Government an effective and trusted civilian workforce. OGC does this by rendering opinions, reviewing proposed policies and other work products, and commenting on their legal efficacy, serving as agency representatives in administrative litigation, and supporting the Department of Justice (DOJ) in its representation of the Government on matters concerning the civilian workforce. OGC also carries out several programmatic, substantive functions that fulfill other statutory or regulatory mandates and, thus, benefit other OPM offices or the Executive Branch as a whole. For example, OGC is responsible for promulgating Hatch Act regulations, administers the internal agency Hatch Act and ethics programs, and serves in a policy and legal role in the Government-wide function of determining which Merit Systems Protection Board and arbitral decisions are erroneous and have a substantial impact on civil service law, and, thus, merit judicial review. Further, consistent with the Government in Ethics Act, OGC, along with DOJ, consults with the United States Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on any regulations related to the Standards of Conduct OGE plans to issue. OPM also administers OPM’s internal program for handling claims lodged under the Federal Tort Claims Act and other statutes and determines when OPM personnel or documents should be made available in discovery to parties in litigation to which OPM is not a party. Congressional, Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (CLIA) is the OPM office that fosters and maintains relationships with Members of the Congress and their staff. CLIA accomplishes its mission by keeping informed of issues related to programs and policies administered by OPM. CLIA staff attend meetings, briefings, markups, and hearings to interact, educate, and advise agency leadership and the Congress, as well as state and local governments. CLIA is also responsible for supporting congressional efforts through providing technical assistance and substantive responses to congressional inquiries. Office of Communications (OC) coordinates a comprehensive effort to inform the public of the Administration’s and OPM’s goals, plans, and activities through various media outlets. The OC provides the American public, Federal agencies, and pertinent stakeholders with accurate information to aid in their planning and decision-making processes. The OC oversees the development of all video products, printed materials, and web content generated by OPM offices. The office develops briefing materials for the Director and other OPM officials for various activities and events. The OC also plans events that amplify the Administration’s and OPM’s agency and Government-wide initiatives. 16 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportSecurity, Suitability, and Credentialing Line of Business (SSCLoB) is an interagency organization that is administratively housed within OPM. The SSCLoB supports the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council, including the Suitability & Credentialing and Security Executive Agents (the Director of OPM and the Director of National Intelligence). The Council is chaired by OMB’s Deputy Director for Management and is accountable to the President for promoting the alignment of personnel vetting processes and driving enterprise-wide reforms. The SSCLoB assists the Council and the Executive Agents – through the Council’s Program Management Office – in its personnel vetting mission by identifying/implementing investments, simplifying the delivery of services, and establishing shared services, as well as promoting reciprocity, efficiency, and effectiveness across the enterprise. Human Capital Data Management and Modernization (HCDMM) was established to lead the Government wide use of human capital data as a strategic asset through innovations in human capital service delivery models, interoperable data management and decision support analytics and tools. HCDMM ensures Federal human capital management data assets are accessible, trustworthy, and meet modern standards for optimal utilization in policy and decision-making for Federal Government Agencies. HCDMM coordinates the strategic management of human capital data across the Federal Government by establishing and overseeing human capital data collection and governance and delivering mission-critical analytical tools and services. HCDMM establishes and continuously modernizes the technology and tools that enable access to timely and accurate workforce data and analytics, achieving a broad strategic vision that encompass the entire employee life-cycle and enables insightful decision-making by leaders across the Federal Government. HCDMM supports this mission through the collection, management, and utilization of interoperable human capital data through the electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) and the Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) Data Warehouse linked to Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) human capital services models - the Human Capital Business Reference Model (HCBRM), the Human Capital Federal Integrated Framework and the Human Capital Information Model. HCDMM’s work encompasses overseeing governance related to human capital data management, including the Federal guides for working with and managing human capital data, requirements for data file submissions to OPM, protocols for human capital data releases, product development, statistical analyses, and data science. Additionally, OPM was pre-designated by OMB as the Human Resource Quality Service Management Office (HR QSMO) and this function has been placed within HCDMM. The HR QSMO will establish a marketplace of services and products that enable agencies to improve the delivery of human capital activities in alignment with, and by operationalizing, the HRLOB related standards. Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Accessibility (ODEIA) provides Government-wide guidance on DEIA efforts including technical assistance to agencies, policy guidance, management of intergovernmental working groups on DEIA and the government wide DEIA strategic plan. ODEIA will primarily focus its actions on externally facing customers and matters but will have an advisory function to senior leaders for internal OPM DEIA efforts. Program Offices Employee Services (ES) is OPM’s workforce policy shop. ES administers statutory and regulatory provisions related to recruitment, hiring, classification, strategic workforce planning, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, leadership and employee development, reskilling, work/life/wellness programs, diversity and inclusion, labor and employee relations, the Administrative Law Judges Program, and oversight of Federal Executive Boards. ES does so by equipping Federal agencies with tools, flexibilities, and authorities, as well as forward-leaning strategic workforce planning products to enable agencies to hire, develop, and retain an effective Federal workforce. 17 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportRetirement Services (RS) is responsible for the administration of the Federal Retirement Program covering nearly 2.8 million active employees, including the United States Postal Service, and more than 2.7 million annuitants, survivors, and family members. RS also administers, develops, and provides Federal employees, annuitants, and their families with benefits programs and services that offer choice, value, and quality to help maintain the Government’s position as a competitive employer. Activities include record maintenance and service credit accounts prior to retirement; initial eligibility determinations at retirement; adjudication of annuity benefits based on age and service, disability, or death based on a myriad of statutes and regulations. Even after a case is adjudicated and added to the annuity roll, OPM continues to serve annuitants by making address or tax status changes to annuitant accounts, sending out 1099-Rs, surveying certain annuitants to confirm their continued eligibility to receive benefits, and conducting other post adjudication activities. Healthcare and Insurance (HI) consolidates OPM’s healthcare and insurance responsibilities into a single organization. This includes contracting, program development, and management functions for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program, the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP), the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP), and the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS). HI is comprised of the Program Development and Support (PDS), Federal Employees Insurance Operations (FEIO), Office of the Actuaries and Operations and Resource Management divisions. PDS is responsible for extensive operational, analytical, and systems development and support; policy and program development and implementation; data collection and analysis; and stakeholder outreach and education for programs administered by HI.

FEIO is responsible for the contracting operations for all insurance programs, the Plan Performance Assessment function connecting health plan quality to carrier profit, the Audit Resolution & Compliance function facilitating and tracking audit responses and resolution, and the Contract Administration and Program Support responsible for leading projects important to insurance operations, including carrier brochure changes and contract amendments. The Office of the Actuaries determines the actuarial liabilities for the Retirement, Health and Life Insurance programs and provides supporting documentation as required by the annual audit of OPM’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Merit System Accountability & Compliance (MSAC) provides rigorous oversight to determine if Federal agency human resources programs are effective and efficient and comply with merit system principles and related civil service regulations. MSAC evaluates agencies’ programs through a combination of OPM-led evaluations and as participants in agency-led reviews. The evaluations may focus on all or some of the four systems of OPM’s Human Capital Framewor k: (1) strategic planning and alignment of human resources to mission, (2) performance culture , (3) talent management, and (4) evaluation systems . MSAC reports may identify required corrective actions, which agencies must show evidence of implementing, as well as recommendations for agencies to improve their systems and procedures. MSAC also conducts special cross-cutting studies to assess the use of HR authorities and flexibilities across the Government. Moreover, MSAC reviews and renders decisions on agencies’ requests to appoint current or former political appointees to positions in the competitive service, the non-political excepted service, or the senior executive service to verify that such appointments conform to applicable selection requirements and are free of political influence. MSAC is required to report to Congress on its review and determinations concerning these appointments. MSAC also adjudicates classification appeals, job grading appeals, Fair Labor Standards Act claims, compensation and leave claims, and declination of reasonable offer appeals (where the grade or pay is equal to or greater than the retained grade (5 CFR 536.402), all of which provides Federal employees with administrative 18 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance Reportprocedural rights to challenge compensation and related agency decisions without having to resort to seeking redress in Federal courts. MSAC has Government-wide oversight of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) and the Voting Rights programs. The mission of the CFC is to promote and support philanthropy through a program that is employee focused, cost-efficient, and effective in providing all Federal employees and annuitants the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all. The Voting Rights Program deploys Federal observers to monitor polling sites (as determined by the Attorney General) and provides written reports to the Department of Justice.

APGs reflect measurable results that leadership wants to accomplish over a two-year period, advancing progress toward longer-term strategic goals and objectives in the agency’s strategic plan. The Federal Government uses a three-pronged approach to manage A PGs: 1) public goal set ting; 2) data-driven performance review meetings with agency leadership no less than quarterly; a nd 3) quarterly public updates on www.Performance.gov . For additional information on APGs, please refer to www.Performance.gov . For the FY 2022-2023 period, OPM developed six APGs. APG 1: Drive a data-driven and leading practices approach to recruitment, assessment, and hiring strategies that strengthens and supports diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across the Federal Government .By September 30, 2023, increase the percent of hiring managers who report they have reviewed applicant flow data trends for their previous recruitment efforts by 5 points. Related Strategic Objective: 1 .1 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM deployed a new Applicant Flow Data warehouse for USA Staffing users. The new data warehouse includes new hiring milestones (tentative offer, official offer, and entry on duty) as well as additional attributes to aid in analysis, including assessment type and recruitment source. OPM also drafted new questions on Applicant Flow Data use for inclusion in the CHCO Hiring Manager survey and began the process of developing guidance on hiring manager use of the data. OPM also made a critical change in the USAJOBS applicant user experience to promote increases in the percentage of applicants who provide their demographic information during the application process. This information forms the basis for Applicant Flow Data, and in recent years, the 22 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance Reportpercentage of applicants who have voluntarily provided demographic information has steadily decreased, likely due to a separate change to the USAJOBS site. OPM ran split (A/B) testing of an improved user experience for Applicant Flow Data collection. The agency’s findings suggest that the changes in the user experience were likely highly significant – 89 percent of users provided their demographic information through the improved experience, compared to 68 percent using the existing site. OPM fully implemented these changes to USAJOBS, and the agency will continue to monitor response rates to determine if additional changes are needed. The agency also deployed a series of application programming interfaces (APIs) in USA Staffing based on the new Applicant Flow Data Warehouse. USA Staffing customer agencies can use these APIs to systematically retrieve Applicant Flow Data for their agency rather than relying on manual data pulls, reducing the amount of time it takes to retrieve data and allowing agencies to spend more time on analysis. OPM also held a brainstorming session with DEIA leaders from across the agency on developing guidance for expanding hiring manager access to Applicant Flow Data. Participants discussed expected use cases for hiring manager Applicant Flow Data, and the protections that should be put in place for applicant confidentiality and proper use. APG 2: Capitalize on new workplace flexibilities to recruit and retain talent . By September 30, 2023, increase the Government-wide number of on-board military spouses by 5 percent, employees with disabilities/targeted disabilities by 5 percent, and early career employees (to include interns, post-secondary, and recent graduates) by 10 percent, as compared to a September 2021 baseline, using existing and new workplace incentives and flexibilities put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Related Strategic Objectives: 1 .2 and 1 .3 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM participated in a military spouse panel discussion with the White House Joining Forces team for military spouses and participated in a Department of Defense webinar with the OPM Director to educate military spouses on how to find employment opportunities in USAJOBS.

APG 3: Improve data collection, use, and sharing to help agencies successfully implement DEIA-focused programs, practices, and policies that support improved equitable services through a more engaged workforce . By September 30, 2023, create easy to use, insight-focused DEIA dashboards used by 75 percent of target agencies, and score an average 4/5 on a customer survey that tests decision-support effectiveness. 23 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportRelated Strategic Objectives: 1 .1 and 4 .3 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM launched the Government-wide DEIA Strategic Plan which set the stage for agencies to develop their own strategic plans to advance DEIA goals and objectives, and then report on those on a regular basis. OPM is developing a new agency-wide human capital data strategy through the agency-wide representation on the Data Governance Board, led by OPM’s Chief Data Officer. The Board created working groups to help drive the implementation of the strategy, including a group focused on data visualization. The Data Visualization Working Group is tasked with developing this DEIA dashboard as a critical early priority, improving OPM’s cross-agency coordination and resource deployment to facilitate the success of this APG. OPM also held ideation sessions with agency Chief Diversity Officers to identify initial areas of focus for the dashboard prototypes. OPM developed DEIA dashboard prototypes with key measures that respond to questions captured during those initial ideation sessions. OPM held additional ideation sessions with agency Chief Diversity Officers and subject matter experts to review the dashboard prototypes and to identify additional enhancements. OPM also progressed in establishing an interim analytics platform that will enable OPM to integrate and automate data from multiple sources, and to provide role-based, authenticated access to the dashboards in FY 2023. OPM also developed authentication and authorization capabilities to support providing role-based access to DEIA dashboards, began design for OPM’s data portal landing page, and identified target agencies for initial rollout. APG 4: Support critical and urgent recruitment and hiring throughout the Federal Government . By September 30, 2023, help Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) agencies fill 75 percent of surge hiring positions identified in the first quarter of FY 2022. Related Strategic Objective: 1 .1 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM assisted Bipartisan Infrastructure Law agencies to reach more than 75 percent of hiring targets for FY 2022 and 53 percent of hiring targets for FY 2023. OPM issued a Talent Surge Executive Playbook and Talent Surge Hiring Authorities index and established Tiger Teams to provide guidance to agencies on outreach, recruitment, and hiring flexibilities. OPM also conducted webinars for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law agencies on topics including Use of Military Spouse Authority, Hiring Senior Executives, Suitability Process, Use of the Presidential Management Fellows Program, Utilizing Direct Hire Authority, Utilizing the Schedule A Hiring Authority, and Overview of Hiring Authorities. The agency also issued cross agency announcements for HR and grants management specialists. In addition, OPM issued new Occupational Series for Wildland Firefighters as required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support the Department of the Interior and the United States Department of Agriculture. OPM made substantial updates to the Wildland Fire Management Position Classification Standard including the series definition, titling, and knowledge required to perform wildland firefighting work, occupational information, and illustrations of work performed by wildland fire fighters. The agency also issued a cross agency announcement for grants management specialists. OPM also provided agencies with flexibilities to assist in expediting the hiring of mission critical staff needed for the talent surge, such as dual compensation waiver requests, Direct Hire Authority requests, ceiling extensions for Schedule A/B authority, and SES and SL/ST position requests. Among other flexibilities, OPM issued Direct Hire Authority for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law agencies in support of human resources hiring needs; issued a Government-wide Schedule A Excepted Service Hiring Authority in support of infrastructure hiring; issued Direct Hire Authority for the Department of Interior in support of infrastructure and wildland fire season; and issued a Dual Compensation Waiver Delegation to the Department of Transportation in support of infrastructure. In addition, OPM developed an Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Agency Public Messaging Toolkit for agencies that includes general talking points, messaging for commencement addresses for agency principals, and 24 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance Reportlanguage for job posts, press releases, and social media. The agency also contributed to the Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Week of Action. OPM collaborated with the USDA to use their radio station and create messaging for Rural America. To communicate the Federal Government’s efforts, Director Ahuja co-wrote an op-ed in the Miami Herald with White House infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu. OPM also provided information on recruitment sourcing, branding, and campus recruitment, primarily in the context of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) and recruitment, to various agencies, and participated in a quarterly Department of Defense Recruiters Consortium meeting to facilitate a question-and-answer session on strategic outreach and recruitment. APG 5: Close gender and racial pay gaps in the Federal Government . By September 30, 2023, issue regulations that will address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting processes for Federal employees. Related Strategic Objectives: 1 .1 and 1 .2 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM calculated gender and racial/ethnic pay gaps for the Federal Government’s civilian workforce in the Executive Branch as of September 2021 and in FY 2023 will issue regulations that address the use of salary history in hiring and pay-setting processes for Federal employees. OPM also began a draft of a memo on pay equity reviews and is requesting agency reports on revisions to non-title 5 compensation practices.APG 6: Improve customer experience by making it easier for Federal employees, annuitants, and other eligible persons to make a more informed health insurance plan selection . By September 30, 2023, complete user-centered design and develop a minimum viable product for a new, state-of-the-art Decision Support Tool that will give eligible individuals the necessary information to compare plan benefits, provider networks, prescription costs, and other health information important to them and their families. Related Strategic Objectives: 1 .1 and 3 .4 FY 2022 Progress Update OPM developed an equity action plan to deploy a Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Decision Support Tool to improve the healthcare shopping experience of all enrollees. The agency refined requirements for the Tool and mapped processes and upgrades to internal OPM business systems. OPM also finalized the Decision Support Tool capability matrix for an updated customer experience-driven health plan and benefit Tool. OPM will use the Tool capability matrix to assist in determining minimum viable product prototype capability, feasibility, and procurement strategy. The matrix will serve as the baseline artifact to create the requirements traceability matrix. In addition, several vendors conducted demonstrations of commercial capabilities for OPM staff as part of market research. OPM commenced efforts to create a strategy to gauge current Plan Comparison Tool and prospective Decision Support Tool user satisfaction and needs. These efforts include the authoring of draft web survey questions which will be used to measure the customer experience of current Plan Comparison Tool users and as a guide for user-centered design focus groups to inform customer needs in the Decision Support Tool. 25 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportOPM plays a leading role in advancing the President’s Management Agenda priority 1 to strengthen and empower the Federal workforce and will also contribute to priority 2 to deliver excellent, equitable, and secure Federal services and customer experience. Per the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 requirement to address cross-agency priority goals in the agency strategic plan, the Annual Performance Plan, and the Annual Performance Report, please refer to www.Performance.gov for OPM’s contributions to those goals and progress where applicable. Cross-Agency Priority Goals 26 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportIn this section, OPM summarizes the performance results for each objective in its FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. OPM gauges its progress toward each objective using one or more performance measures. Some objectives are most appropriately measured with milestones, which are scheduled events signifying the completion of a major deliverable or a phase of work. The agency compares actual performance to targets. In some instances, noted with the phrase Establish Baseline, measures are new and there is no baseline data. In those cases, OPM deferred setting firm targets until the agency collects enough data to set ambitious, but achievable, targets. The tables that follow display performance results, ordered by strategic goal, for FY 2022, where available. Trends are visualized in small “spark” charts that represent the FY 2022 results, subject to data availability. Note that the scales of spark charts are not displayed, and they are automatically adjusted to “zoom in” on the data. This can have the effect of making small changes appear more significant, while making large changes appear less significant. In the next section, OPM explains any variances or trends, identifies any successful or promising practices, and where OPM did not meet targets, describes plans for improvement. Please refer to the specific table numbers that follow for additional details, including explanations of the results.

By FY 2026, increase a Government-wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility index score by 6 percentage points . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance towards this objective is making noteworthy progress. In FY 2022, OPM established a new Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility. As a part of the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Initiative established by Executive Order 14035 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce, the agency and its partners conducted a series of initial outreach meetings with CFO Act agencies to discuss their agency DEIA strategic plans, learn about agency collaborations, and identify how the DEIA Initiative can support agencies during the next phase of the Executive Order’s implementation. OPM collected agency self-assessments of current DEIA practices from Federal agencies to benchmark efforts in DEIA to inform the Government-wide Strategic Plan to Advance DEIA in the Federal Workforce. OPM also provided agencies support in advance of the publication of the plans, including guidance for developing agency DEIA implementation teams. In addition, OPM also created a summary Fact Sheet ( https:/ /www.opm.gov/news/releases/2022/07/fact-sheet- building-a-better-workforce-for-the-american-people/ ) to inform all agencies on progress made and messaging for DEIA strategic plans. Further, OPM collaborated with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), OMB, and the Domestic Policy Council in meetings with CFO Act agencies to seek feedback on support needed for Year 2 implementation and reporting. 40 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportAs outlined in Executive Order 14035, OPM launched the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council. The Council, under the leadership of Chair and OPM Director Kiran Ahuja, Vice Chairs Jason Miller and Charlotte Burrows of OMB and EEOC, respectively, and Dr. Janice Underwood as Government-wide Chief Diversity Officer, is a collaborative interagency body and a force-multiplier for DEIA work taking place across the Federal Government. The Council aims to advance DEIA initiatives across the Federal Government by bringing together and sharing promising policies and practices from both the public and private sectors. OPM also introduced the OPM FEVS DEIA Index using OPM FEVS items piloted in FY 2021. OPM designed these items to measure employees’ perceptions of whether, and to what extent, DEIA is successfully advanced and embedded throughout the workforce. Agencies will use their 2022 OPM FEVS results, in addition to other DEIA agency assessments, to gauge progress towards the objectives of their agency DEIA strategic plans.

OPM scored highest (74.7 percent) on the item “Managers communicate the goals of the organization,” and lowest (57.4 percent) on “In my organization, senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce.” 52 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportStrategic Goal 3: Create a human- centered customer experience by putting the needs of OPM’s customers at the center of OPM’s workforce services, policy, and oversight, increasing OPM’s customer satisfaction index score for targeted services to 4.3 out of 5 Strategic Objective 3 .1: Enhance the Retirement Services customer experience by providing timely, accurate, and responsive service that addresses the diverse needs of OPM’s customers . By FY 2026, improve the customer satisfaction score to 4 .2 out of 5 . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement. OPM implemented a cloud-based contact center, a multi-channel call center solution. Through this call center solution, OPM increased its capability to receive customer inquiries by reducing busy signals, allowing more customers into the call queue, and allowing customers to request a callback. OPM also implemented an email component of the new cloud-based contact center. The email component allows OPM to identify and block spam emails so contact center agents can identify and respond to actual customers, and includes a quick response feature which allows agents to provide standard responses quicker. OPM applied plain language writing to clarify information on survivor benefits on its website. OPM also applied human-centered design to develop a prototype of a retirement guide. The guide is a plain language resource that is intended to help customers better understand the retirement application process. OPM plans to pilot the guide with agency partners in FY 2023. OPM deployed a new login process ( Login.gov ) for Services Online ― OPM’s online portal that allows annuitants (Federal retirees or their spouses, ex-spouses, and children) to manage their accounts online. Login.gov provides a single sign-on solution for Government websites that enables citizens to access public services across different agencies using the same email address and password, and provides a more seamless and secure user experience. In addition, OPM advanced efforts to revise the Retirement Services customer experience survey to focus on the new annuitant experience. OPM also identified and compiled material on 698 relevant training topics for Retirement Services staff. OPM plans to create a standardized curriculum in five core areas: foundations, basic claims, disability claims, post-adjudication claims, and survivor claims. 53 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportTable 3 .1 .001 - No historical data available for this period.

Monthly average call wait times ranged from 28 to 34 minutes. The new cloud-based contact center allows more customers into the call queue, so customers experience fewer busy signals but longer wait times. To help reduce call wait times, OPM implemented a callback feature. In FY 2022, approximately 46 percent of customers have taken advantage of this feature. In FY 2023, OPM plans to improve the content on its website and implement a retirement guide, which may help to reduce call wait times.

With 40,322 respondents in FY 2022, the response rate was 11 percent. The average satisfaction score for services received from Retirement Services declined 4.6 percent compared to FY 2021. In FY 2023, OPM plans to launch an updated customer satisfaction survey focused on the new annuitant’s experience applying for and receiving retirement benefits. By focusing on this customer segment, OPM will be better able to understand the potential drivers of satisfaction and make targeted improvements. 54 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportStrategic Objective 3 .2: Create a personalized USAJOBS experience to help applicants find relevant opportunities . By FY 2026, improve applicant satisfaction to 4 .1 out of 5 for the desktop platform and to 4 .5 out of 5 for the mobile platform . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress. In FY 2022, OPM completed a successful pilot and deployed an Applicant Counts feature on USAJOBS, which promotes transparency about the size of the applicant pool for a job opportunity and sets realistic expectations about competition for Federal positions. OPM made the new feature available to its Talent Acquisition System partners, and USA Staffing became the first Talent Acquisition System to implement the feature. From the feature’s launch in March through August 31, the monthly average of USAJOBS vacancies displaying Applicant Counts was 27.5 percent. OPM also implemented a Branded Search Page feature on USAJOBS, which allows agencies to add their recruitment brand to their agency’s unique announcement search results page, creating a more tailored search experience for job seekers and enabling agencies to engage in more proactive recruitment activities. USAJOBS leverages this capability to create branded, filtered search pages for Government- wide campaigns, such as Bipartisan Infrastructure Law hiring. USAJOBS also released a Remote Work option, which improves the search experience for job seekers by filtering jobs designated as “remote.” OPM deployed several internal dashboards, including a Talent Acquisition Dashboard, which includes high-level measures from USAJOBS. OPM also developed an Applicant Flow Data Dashboard which provides information on how different demographic groups progress through the hiring process. Integrated OPM teams are actively collaborating to build the infrastructure to enable external user access to these and other dashboards. While OPM collaborated with the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Login.gov team to improve the USAJOBS authentication experience, OPM encountered impediments that stalled progress in this area, including a lack of adequate opportunities for sharing customer experience insights. GSA continued to iterate and improve its security, privacy, and user experience for the authentication experience. GSA is also engaged with several large customers in implementing a higher-level authentication service, hiring new senior leadership for Login.gov , and building their customer account management capacity. OPM and GSA’s Login.gov team partnered to conduct a usability and equity audit of Login.gov ’s multi-factor authentication account creation process to identify areas for improvement for the applicant experience across USAJOBS and Login.gov services. The team has begun analyzing the audit findings and recommendations as they apply to Login.gov , USAJOBS, and other OPM products that integrate with Login.gov and will implement improvements in the coming year. With a focus on enhancing applicant communications, OPM created a Resume Readiness & FAQs handout to share with applicants and other stakeholders. The agency also developed the first two of a series of USAJOBS videos. The videos help job applicants navigate the Federal application and hiring process and better understand the meaning of eligible versus qualified in a job announcement. OPM also conducted an A/B test to test options to increase disclosure of demographic data in user profiles and applications. OPM found that website revisions were successful and deployed changes across USAJOBS, resulting in progress on demographic disclosure. 55 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportTable 3 .2 .001 - No historical data available for this period.

In FY 2022, USAJOBS’ desktop customer experience results increased slightly in all areas except for the “trust score,” which decreased by .01 points. OPM has observed that when USAJOBS implements noticeable user experience changes, satisfaction often decreases. However, over the last four years, USAJOBS’ customer experience trends reflect consistent results or small increases due to the feature enhancements deployed within USAJOBS. In FY 2023, OPM will continue to identify ways to improve feedback collection throughout the applicant journey to drive improvements and improve overall satisfaction with USAJOBS.

By FY 2026, increase the average score for helpfulness of OPM human capital services in achieving human capital objectives to 4 .5 out of 5 . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM promoted collaboration across programs in its support of agencies impacted by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). OPM created listening channels to engage agency partners to better understand and provide guidance responsive to their surge hiring needs. OPM administered an online surge hiring strategic talent plan questionnaire to obtain more specific details on talent acquisition goals and anticipated priorities, classification requirements, occupational series, timing, staffing, and HR hiring staff readiness to support the hiring surge. OPM also hosted recurring agency meetings comprised of a specialized team to integrate agency-specific BIL data into OPM dashboards, obtain agency-requested information to vet answers with appropriate subject-matter experts, and coordinate talent surge planning next steps. Further, OPM established a webinar series focused on specialized topics of interest to BIL-impacted agencies, such as using the new BIL Schedule A and other hiring authorities, navigating the Agency Talent Portal, pay and leave flexibilities, and using the Presidential Management Fellows Program to quickly meet surge hiring needs. In addition, OPM provided support to each of these agencies as they met with the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs to present their progress. Six months after implementation, OPM hosted a series of workshops with each of the agencies to glean lessons learned and leading practices. In each section, OPM included subject matter experts who were selected based on data from a survey which asked each agency to share their specific challenges. OPM aggregated feedback from these sessions to inform the agency’s planned support in FY 2023. To further advance the customer experience, OPM modified its oversight evaluation methodology. In FY 2022, OPM fully implemented a modified oversight evaluation methodology that it initially developed in FY 2021. Through this approach, OPM strategic leaders and human capital review teams leverage robust and inclusive quantitative and qualitative data from multiple data sources, including EHRI, USAStaffing, USAJOBS, OPM FEVS, and the Hiring Manager Customer Satisfaction Survey, to facilitate oversight and promote transparency.

By FY 2026, achieve an average effectiveness score of 4 out of 5 . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement. The agency completed customer experience research as well as analyses of historical OPM.gov analytics and the Federal Employee Journey to drive the conceptualization of a modernized OPM.gov . OPM also identified resources to develop backend infrastructure for OPM’s website modernization. To address immediate customer needs, OPM updated language on the survivor benefit web page to address a source of confusion for annuitants that is the subject of many calls to OPM Retirement Service’s call center. In FY 2022, the Technology Modernization Fund Board, chaired by the Federal CIO and comprised of Government IT leaders, announced an investment of more than $6 million for the OPM website and digital modernization. With this funding, OPM will update both the technology behind and the content on the OPM.gov website in order to improve and optimize the user experience for the site’s 22 million unique annual visitors. Currently, customers experience difficulty navigating the site, using the tools effectively, and finding the information they need. The almost 20,000 pages on OPM.gov contain 3,600 dead links, creating a confusing user experience for current Federal employees, job seekers, annuitants, and HR professionals who visit OPM.gov expecting up-to-date and easily accessible information.

By FY 2026 , increase the percentage of employees who agree that innovation is valued by 4 points . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM launched the OPM Innovation in Service Delivery Design pilot program and worked with three teams from throughout the agency seeking to introduce innovation to improve service delivery performance. Through a series of customized workshops and consultations, the teams worked to identify root problems and key challenges, thought critically about the status quo, and brainstormed ways to improve service delivery. The pilot program culminated in an agency-wide, virtual Innovation Summit that served as a celebration of teams’ work and as a forum for the teams to share what they learned about innovation through the pilot program and how they used service design to inform their service delivery or customer service. Following the Summit, all OPM employees attending also had a chance to engage in breakout discussion groups to spark conversations around innovation throughout OPM, as well as participate in skill-building mini-labs to encourage cross-organizational conversations on introducing or sustaining innovation at OPM. OPM also conducted exploratory research and interviews to develop ideas and a concept for an idea center and learning community to engage OPM employees in conversations around innovation. OPM began to compile educational materials and resources to inform a toolkit, which will serve as a resource for future trainings offered to employees. Combined together, the research, educational materials, and execution of the pilot program and Innovation Summit inform plans to launch another pilot of the OPM Innovation in Service Delivery Design program in FY 2023, as well as two informal innovation “Lunch and Learns” to further engage the OPM workforce. 64 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportTable 4 .1 .001 - No historical data available for this period.

These programs will create more opportunities and forums for OPM leaders to be trained in innovation techniques. Additionally, in FY 2023, OPM anticipates having a Chief Learning Officer on board, who will scope and advance an enterprise training plan. 65 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportStrategic Objective 4 .2: Increase focus on Government-wide policy work by shifting more low-risk delegations of authorities to agencies . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM developed a list of 25 transactional activities to review for possible delegation to agencies, including 13 CHCO-identified proposed delegations, the time-limited delegations provided to agencies in response to the CARES Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, transactional activities from OPM’s legislative proposals and Unified Agenda, and 12 potential delegations from a National Academy of Public Administration study published in 2021. OPM established assessment criteria to determine if the work would be considered low, medium, or high risk for delegation, and determined that 9 of the 25 transactional activities posed either a low or medium risk for delegation. OPM also identified steps the agency can take to mitigate the risks associated with delegating transactional activities deemed to be a medium risk. OPM has incorporated into the agency’s legislative agenda recommendations to delegate the agreed to authorities. OPM is working to coordinate next steps for this objective with the legislative process timeline. Table 4 .2 .001 - No historical data available for this period.

By FY 2026, increase the percentage of CHCO survey respondents who agree that OPM provides agencies with high quality workforce data and information to be used in decision-making by 20 percentage points . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress. To improve data governance, OPM developed a new charter for an enterprise Data Governance Board, which is responsible for creating and implementing an OPM data strategy focused on improving the quality and use of OPM’s Federal human capital data. The Data Governance Board completed a data and digital maturity model survey to better understand organizational capability gaps. OPM then developed a data strategy action plan for calendar year 2022 aligned with the Federal Data Strategy, including goals focused on improving data governance, data visualization and analytics, data infrastructure, data sharing, and data skills across the agency. OPM took foundational steps to improve data quality and timeliness by developing and deploying data quality dashboards on human capital data collected from agencies across Government in the Enterprise Human Resources Integration data warehouse. OPM also began expanding the accessibility of HR analytics tools and reports by developing and deploying human capital dashboards across OPM, piloting external agency access to the dashboards, and planning implementation of the necessary technology infrastructure to provide access Government-wide. Additionally, OPM successfully deployed a series of Application Programming Interfaces for agency access to USA Staffing and USAJOBS data. To create a framework for improving standardization and integration of human capital data, OPM’s Human Resources Line of Business released data standards on substantial portions of the employee lifecycle, including talent acquisition, separation and retirement, and labor relations.

By FY 2026, provide Federal agencies with 25 best practices . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM established a dedicated dashboard to track the hiring process for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This enabled agencies’ real-time tracking of hiring, allowing targeted efforts to reduce the time to hire and promoting accountability for meeting hiring goals. OPM shared these data-driven decision-making practices, which have improved the hiring process with the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council, agency talent teams, and other audiences. OPM also researched promising practices centered on the use of technology in human capital management and the Future of Work. OPM partnered with the Robotic Process Automation Community of Practice to identify agencies that implemented automation to improve and streamline human capital processes and allow Federal employees to focus on high-value work. OPM and its partners launched an agency showcase series which featured demonstrations of identification tools that agencies use to designate positions as eligible for remote work or telework.

OPM will continue to share leading practices in OPM guidance documents, through agency Showcase events, and via the Leading Practices MAX site, which will launch in FY 2023.In addition, OPM developed and widely shared a website to share leading practices and promote innovation with other agencies. OPM also formed an internal working group to review the agency’s demonstration project and research authorities and held a CHCO Personnel Policy Office Hours session to understand the barriers for Federal agencies to use this authority and how it can be revised or updated to better meet agencies’ needs. OPM is working to streamline demonstration project authority and make it easier for agencies to use and improve the data it produces. OPM continues to engage with agency partners to explore the feasibility of conducting pilots using the demonstration project authority to test human capital reforms, leverage lessons learned during the pandemic, and advance efforts related to the Future of Work. OPM’s new Hiring Experience Group is working with agency talent teams to explore innovative ways to improve Federal hiring, including piloting shared certifications. OPM launched a pilot with three agencies to share hiring certifications for contract specialists and cybersecurity positions. 70 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportStrategic Objective 4 .5: Revamp OPM’s policy-making approach to be proactive, timely, systematic, and inclusive . By FY 2026, increase the percent of CHCOs who agree that OPM’s policy approach is responsive to agency needs by 8 percentage points FY 2022 Progress Update OPM created workgroups with the goals of accelerating the timeliness of the OPM clearance process, promoting stakeholder awareness and engagement with key policies, and incorporating qualitative input from stakeholders into the development and prioritization of policy development. As part of this effort, OPM developed a process to create an open dialogue with agency CHCOs to improve communication, researched training opportunities for OPM staff, and started building a pilot program for policy rollouts. OCIO also added a new feature to OPM’s document management system that adds parallel routing, which allows users from different offices to review submissions simultaneously.

By FY 2026, improve CHCO agreement that human capital policy changes resulted in less administrative burden to agencies by 8 percentage points . FY 2022 Progress Update OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement. OPM reviewed current hiring authorities and identified approximately 170 hiring authorities and implemented a cross-agency team to begin reviewing usage and applicability to determine if underutilized or duplicative authorities can be eliminated. OPM also successfully transitioned 50 forms from wet signature to electronic signature, reducing considerable burden on agencies. In OPM’s FY 2022 CHCO Survey, CHCOs requested several policy and systems changes, including raising the 15 percent cap on post-secondary student appointments, automating notices from USAPerformance®, authorizing the use of automation to develop hiring certificates in USAStaffing®, and coordinating timing of data calls. OPM is currently considering or planning actions to address these requested policy and systems changes. Through a review of data calls, OPM is identifying where data availability can be improved to eliminate the need for separate data calls.

The performance information in this report is reasonably complete and reliable, as defined by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010. The following section describes the steps that OPM has taken to promote the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the performance information it reports for each measure. Additionally, the following steps outline agency-wide efforts to promote data quality: • OPM developed and regularly updates dashboards with the agency’s performance results, facilitating senior management review. Senior agency leaders participate in Results OPM performance review meetings at least quarterly. This process includes substantiating that actual results reported are indeed correct whenever those results reveal substantial changes in trends or variances from targets. • The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides guidance to Objective Teams on data quality, and has developed a standard form for Objective Teams to document data collection and reporting procedures, definitions, source data, validation and verification, and limitations. The OCFO reviews such documentation for adequacy, providing feedback and recommendations for improvement to Objective Teams. This documentation serves as a job aid to performance measurement and reporting staff, helping to promote the use of consistent definitions and methods. • To reduce manual processes and the risk of human error, OCFO has developed a new application for performance data collection and reporting, and began using the application in FY 2022. • OCFO, Goal Owners, and Objective Owners assess the use and effectiveness of the agency’s performance measures and consider alternative measures during the agency’s annual performance budgeting process. Cross-organizational teams of Objective Owners establish consensus on the validity of the measures. These agency-wide efforts, in addition to the specific actions that Goal and Objective Owners have taken for each measure, as described in the following section, support the completeness, reliability, and quality of OPM’s performance information. 74 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportMeasure Definitions, Data Sources, Verification, and Validation Strategic Goal 1: Position the Federal Government as a model employer, improving the Government-wide satisfaction index score by 4 points . Strategic Objective 1.1: Achieve a Federal workforce that is drawn from the diversity of America, exhibited at all levels of Government, by supporting agencies in fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible workplaces. By FY 2026, increase a Government-wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility index score by 6 percentage points. Performance Measure: Government-wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility index score Reference Item Description Definition The average of the scores on a five-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) for the following OPM FEVS items related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility: My organization’s management practices promote diversity (e .g ., outreach, recruitment, promotion opportunities) . My supervisor demonstrates a commitment to workforce diversity (e .g ., recruitment, promotion opportunities, development) . I have similar access to advancement opportunities (e .g ., promotion, career development, training) as others in my work unit . My supervisor provides opportunities fairly to all employees in my work unit (e .g ., promotions, work assignments) . In my work unit, excellent work is similarly recognized for all employees (e .g ., awards, acknowledgements) . Employees in my work unit treat me as a valued member of the team . Employees in my work unit make me feel I belong . Employees in my work unit care about me as a person . I am comfortable expressing opinions that are different from other employees in my work unit . In my work unit, people’s differences are respected . I can be successful in my organization being myself . I can easily make a request of my organization to meet my accessibility needs .

OPM’s Survey Analysis Group within Employee Services leads the survey administration and conducts extensive data analysis to verify the results and identify any systemic data issues . OPM FEVS is a web-based survey and the instrument has built-in programs to inspect data for various response errors or out of range values; thus, data cleaning is a continuous operation throughout the data collection period . Data Limitations The OPM FEVS is administered annually and reflects employee opinions at a single point in time . Events around the time of the data collection (historicity effect) could possibly influence results . Not all executive agencies participate in the OPM FEVS . For example, US Department of Veterans Affairs no longer participates . The OPM FEVS response rate varies but is generally around 45 percent . However, it is important to note that the large sample size (OPM sent the 2020 survey to more than 1 .41 million employees, with 624,800 employees completing a survey), combined with the weighting procedures described above, support the accuracy of the survey data . 76 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportStrategic Objective 1.2: Develop a Government-wide vision and strategy and implement policies and initiatives that embrace the future of work and position the Federal Government as a model employer with respect to hiring, talent development, competitive pay, benefits, and workplace flexibilities.

A sufficient number of qualified applicants were referred for hiring consideration (weighted 30 percent) . 18 . The applicants who were referred had the skills to perform the job (weighted 40 percent) . 23 . I received the certificate of eligible applicants from the human resources office in a timely manner (weighted 15 percent) . 24 . The overall hiring process occurred in a timely manner (weighted 15 percent) . Data Source Hiring Manager Satisfaction Survey Frequency Annual Verification and Validation The vendor that administers the Hiring Manager Satisfaction Survey provides quarterly verification of data completeness and accuracy . As part of the verification process, responses to the survey items are checked for appropriate and accurate coding, including no out of range responses and responses corresponded with survey skip patterns . A team of industrial and organizational psychologists assists in the creation, development, and monitoring of the survey process . The survey, including individual questions, has been vetted and approved by subject matter experts and the CHCO Council . Data Limitations Data and results are based upon the responses from those who voluntarily complete the survey and who self-identify as having participated in the hiring process . These responses provide a portrayal of their perceptions and experiences regarding the timeliness of services and quality of applicants received . However, the number of service recipients is currently unknown as not every hiring manager completes the survey . To promote use of the survey, USAStaffing, which 75 percent of Federal agencies use as their Talent Acquisition System, automates the survey process while OPM works with the other Talent Acquisition Systems used by 25 percent of Federal agencies to further automate the survey process . Because three agencies represent almost 70 percent of responses, they have a disproportionate impact on the overall results of the Hiring Quality and Timeliness Index .

By FY 2026, increase the percentage of employees who agree that innovation is valued by 4 points. Performance Measure: OPM Innovation score Reference Item Description Definition The average of the scores for the following OPM FEVS items: • My work unit commits resources to develop new ideas (e .g ., budget, staff, time, expert support) . • Employees in my work unit incorporate new ideas into their work . • Employees in my work unit consistently look for ways to improve customer service . • Management encourages innovation . Data Source OPM FEVS: Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey Frequency Annual Verification and Validation Between 2010 and 2019, response rates to the OPM FEVS ranged between 41 and 52 percent . Thus, the cleaned OPM FEVS data are weighted so that survey estimates accurately represent the survey population (unweighted data could produce biased estimates of population statistics) . The final data set reflects the agency composition and demographic makeup of the Federal workforce within plus or minus one percentage point . Demographic results are not weighted . Additional details of OPM FEVS validation methods are found in the appendix of the Government-wide Management Report for the relevant year at https://www .opm .gov/fevs . OPM’s Survey Analysis Group within Employee Services leads the survey administration and conducts extensive data analysis to verify the results and identify any systemic data issues . OPM FEVS is a web-based survey and the instrument has built-in programs to inspect data for various response errors or out of range values; thus, data cleaning is a continuous operation throughout the data collection period . Data Limitations The OPM FEVS is administered annually and reflects employee opinions at a single point in time . Events around the time of the data collection (historicity effect) could possibly influence results . Not all executive agencies participate in the OPM FEVS . For example, US Department of Veterans Affairs no longer participates . The OPM FEVS response rate varies but is generally around 45 percent . However, it is important to note that the large sample size (OPM sent the 2020 survey to more than 1 .4 million employees, with 624,800 employees completing a survey), combined with the weighting procedures described above, support the accuracy of the survey data . 98 OPM Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Performance ReportPerformance Measure: Percent of OPM leaders trained in innovation techniques (Cumulative) Reference Item Description Definition The number of OPM employees classified as supervisors and managers, team leaders, leaders, and management officials trained in innovation techniques divided by the total number of supervisors and managers, team leaders, leaders, and management officials .
