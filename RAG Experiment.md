Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project


Assuming a dataset to use with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), here's how to test different embedding techniques and compare their effectiveness:

## Testing Different Embedding Techniques

1. Choose Embedding Models:
   Select 2-3 different embedding models to compare. Good options include:
   - Sentence-BERT (SBERT) models
   - OpenAI's text-embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002)
   - HuggingFace's sentence-transformers models

2. Implement Embedding Generation:
   Create functions to generate embeddings using each chosen model. For example:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from openai import OpenAI

def sbert_embed(text):
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    return model.encode(text)

def openai_embed(text):
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=text, model="text-embedding-ada-002")
    return response.data[0].embedding
```

3. Generate Embeddings:
   Apply each embedding function to your dataset.

4. Set Up Vector Database:
   Choose a vector database that's easy to use and supports multiple index types. Qdrant is a good option for this purpose[1][2].

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import VectorParams, Distance

client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=384, distance=Distance.COSINE)
)
```

5. Index Embeddings:
   Store the embeddings from each model in separate collections or with different naming conventions.

6. Implement RAG:
   Create a simple RAG pipeline using each set of embeddings.

7. Evaluate Performance:
   Test the RAG system with a set of queries and evaluate based on metrics like relevance, accuracy, and response quality.

## Recommended Vector Database: Qdrant

Qdrant is an excellent choice for this experiment for several reasons:

1. Ease of Use: Qdrant has a straightforward API and good documentation, making it easy to set up and use[1][2].

2. Multiple Index Types: It supports various indexing methods, allowing you to experiment with different approaches[1].

3. Performance: Qdrant offers good query performance, which is crucial for RAG applications[1].

4. Flexibility: It allows for easy switching between different embedding types and sizes[2].

5. Integration: Qdrant integrates well with popular RAG frameworks like LangChain[2].

To use Qdrant:

1. Install the client:
```bash
pip install qdrant-client
```

2. Start a Qdrant instance (you can use Docker for easy setup).

3. Connect and create collections for each embedding type:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import VectorParams, Distance

client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)

# Create a collection for each embedding type
for embed_type in ["sbert", "openai"]:
    client.create_collection(
        collection_name=f"{embed_type}_collection",
        vectors_config=VectorParams(size=your_embedding_size, distance=Distance.COSINE)
    )
```

4. Index your embeddings:

```python
client.upload_points(
    collection_name=f"{embed_type}_collection",
    points=[
        PointStruct(
            id=idx,
            vector=embedding,
            payload={"text": original_text}
        )
        for idx, (embedding, original_text) in enumerate(zip(embeddings, texts))
    ]
)
```

5. Perform similarity search:

```python
search_result = client.search(
    collection_name=f"{embed_type}_collection",
    query_vector=query_embedding,
    limit=5
)
```

By using this approach with Qdrant, you should be able to compare the effectiveness of different embedding techniques in a RAG system. They can evaluate factors such as retrieval accuracy, query speed, and overall system performance to determine which embedding method works best for their specific use case.

Docugami Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) Datasets
This repository contains various datasets for advanced RAG over a multiple documents. We created these since we noticed that existing eval datasets were not adequately reflecting RAG use cases that we see in production. Specifically, they were doing Q&A over a single (or just a few) docs when in reality customers often need to RAG over larger sets of documents.

The goal with our dataset is to reflect real-life customer usage by incorporating:

QnA over multiple documents, more than just a few
Use more realistic long-form documents that are similar to documents customers use, not just standard academic examples
Include questions of varying degree of difficulty, including:

Single-Doc, Single-Chunk RAG: Questions where the answer can be found in a contiguous region (text or table chunk) of a single doc. To correctly answer, the RAG system needs to retrieve the correct chunk and pass it to the LLM context. 

For example: What did Microsoft report as its net cash from operating activities in the Q3 2022 10-Q?
Single-Doc, Multi-Chunk RAG: Questions where the answer can be found in multiple non-contiguous regions (text or table chunks) of a single doc. To correctly answer, the RAG system needs to retrieve multiple correct chunks from a single doc which can be challenging for certain types of questions. For example: For Amazon's Q1 2023, how does the share repurchase information in the financial statements correlate with the equity section in the management discussion?

Multi-Doc RAG: Questions where the answer can be found in multiple non-contiguous regions (text or table chunks) across multiple docs. To correctly answer, the RAG system needs to retrieve multiple correct chunks from multiple docs. For example: How has Apple's revenue from iPhone sales fluctuated across quarters?
